<h2 id="the-queen-s-award">The Queen’s Award</h2>
<h2 id="for-enterprise">for Enterprise</h2>
<p>The Enterprise Agile approach is a distillation of years of our learnings
from delivering industrial-strength software for clients in some of the
most complex environments, and has been recognised with a Queen’s
Award for Enterprise in the Innovation category.</p>
<h2 id="foreword">Foreword</h2>
<p>When our company was founded in 1993, one of our core principles
was a total focus on delivery. In our constant search to deliver on
that vision, we have dedicated a great deal of effort to discover what
works and what doesn’t when designing, delivering, and maintaining
enterprise-scale systems.</p>
<p>One of our core values as a business is the pride we take in sharing
our knowledge and expertise with clients. We first published this book
in 2008 to distill thousands of work years of real-world experience of
creating industrial-strength software in some of the most demanding
public and private sector environments. And we’ve regularly updated
the book to document how our thinking has changed with the constantly
changing trends in technology and business.</p>
<p>Enterprise Agile is now in its tenth edition, and we have evolved our
approach as global pressures drive our clients to implement new
business models, and as innovations in technology redefine the way
organisations operate. This latest update includes a chapter about
how enterprise-level organisations can drive value through data-led
programmes, outlining Agile approaches to the data challenge that our
clients have found useful.</p>
<p>We hope you find something of value here and that we have helped
encourage you to put into practice some of the techniques we describe.</p>

<h1 id="the-agility">The Agility</h1>
<h1 id="challenge">Challenge</h1>
<p>18 The Agility Challenge</p>
<p>Irrespective of the nature of your organisation, the chances
are you are grappling with the same challenge - how to more
rapidly and reliably adapt to the changing demands of clients,
consumers or citizens within a shifting global marketplace.</p>
<p>While the drive to do things faster, cheaper and better is not new,
the number of sectors being disrupted by innovative commercial
models powered by digital technologies is unprecedented. These
inventive new offerings further increase the expectations of
customers, driving organisations to quickly adapt their services,
or risk becoming irrelevant.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In the first edition of Enterprise Agile, published in 2008, we focused on
the use of Agile techniques to deliver software projects. Since then, we
have delivered many more projects using our Enterprise Agile method.</p>
<p>In the light of the Covid-19 pandemic, these techniques, as well as the
values and principles that underpin them, have been demonstrated
to be relevant beyond just software delivery. During a period of
unprecedented disruption, some previously successful organisations
have tragically failed to survive. Others, however, have been able to
respond quickly and effectively to the changes thrust upon them, their
customers and their employees. These organisations have been able to
survive, and in some cases thrive, in a radically different world.</p>
<p>At a time of rapid upheaval, Agility is no longer the preserve of Software
Development Teams in isolation from the rest of the enterprise. It is
increasingly important that the entire organisation follows Agile values
and principles and is capable of rapid change.</p>
<p>The Agility Challenge 19</p>
<p>In response to these changes, we have updated our approach once
again. In this revised edition, we look not only at the software
delivery lifecycle but also at the wider subject of building and running
technology-led products and services in an Agile organisation. This
expanded scope includes areas such as remote and hybrid working,
enterprise data, integrating business change, Design Thinking, service
management, Cloud and software-defined infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>We have significantly expanded the scope of our method, but the
underlying principles remain:</strong></p>
<p>**1. An absolute focus on high-quality delivery</p>
<ol>
<li>A risk-first approach to prioritising delivery and change</li>
<li>Strong architecture and engineering principles at the core</li>
<li>Using only ‘Necessary and Sufficient’ processes and artefacts</li>
<li>Delivering change with a ‘No surprises endgame’.**</li>
</ol>
<p>As in previous editions of this book, we explore current concepts, outline
our views and experience, and present our approach for successful
delivery. We aim to help all organisations address the Agility challenge
with a focus on the delivery of high-quality, technology-led products
and services.</p>
<p>20 The Agility Challenge</p>
<h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2>
<h3 id="the-drivers-for-agility">The Drivers for Agility</h3>
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic and the events that followed, taught us just
how unpredictable the future can be and the critical importance of
being able to respond rapidly to the changes to market conditions and
consumer behaviours.</p>
<p>Amid an unprecedented level of global upheaval, digital technologies
continue to be a key catalyst for increased Agility. Digital adoption has
skyrocketed across virtually every industry and customer segment,
prompting many organisations to reconsider their entire business
model. Social media enables near-instant feedback, making or
breaking products and services overnight. As economic pressures
have intensified, consumers have become increasingly fickle, and the
abundance of aggregators such as price comparison engines makes
shopping around easier than ever before. Long term brand loyalty is
much less prevalent when consumer purchasing decisions are driven
by price.</p>
<p>As a result, organisations are seeking to transform themselves and
embed the ability to change to meet customer needs into the fabric of
who they are. By reorganising themselves to rapidly deliver business and
technological change, businesses can respond to the challenges of:</p>
<p><strong>○ Global events that transform customer needs, invalidate business
models, and necessitate new and different operating models</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Disruption of a whole industry sector by innovative commercial
models delivered by digital technologies</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Reduced customer loyalty and the ease of switching to new
service providers</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Demand from a technologically savvy customer base that is
increasingly seeking better digital experiences.</strong></p>
<p>The Agility Challenge 21</p>
<h3 id="delivering-more-with-less">Delivering More with Less</h3>
<p>Not only do organisations now face unprecedented pressure to rapidly
change and deliver new services, but they must also increase efficiency
and minimise expenditure while doing so. Doing more with less is a
common theme across all industry sectors, and achieving it means not
only delivering change effectively but also becoming more efficient at
running existing products and services.</p>
<p>Success is no longer measured by delivering a pre-defined scope on
time and to budget. The success of a product is defined by its ability
to deliver business value by meeting customer needs. The challenge
organisations face is delivering this value with the minimum expenditure
possible and then, once delivered, gathering feedback from customers
to build the next iteration as rapidly and cost-effectively as possible.</p>
<p>Considerable work has been done over the years on Lean thinking in
manufacturing, and Agile delivery in technology. At BJSS we talk about
efficiency in terms of lightweight processes supporting the ‘Necessary
and Sufficient’ tasks for predictable and efficient delivery.</p>
<h3 id="managing-risk">Managing Risk</h3>
<p>A desire for predictability in project and technology delivery is common
to all our conversations with clients. Organisations are driven to plan
and budget in annual cycles, often as a result of the need to meet
short-term shareholder or stakeholder expectations. Corporate
governance often drives risk avoidance behaviours that are counter to
the need to evolve and innovate for long term survival.</p>
<p>Every organisation must innovate and embrace Agility to survive in
markets that are being disrupted with greater frequency than ever
before. Innovation and Agility are the essential ingredients of a modern
successful organisation, but embracing Agility cannot result in a loss</p>
<p>22 The Agility Challenge</p>
<p>of control or governance. Over many years we have adapted Agile
techniques to harness the benefits of incremental delivery and the
flexibility to change whilst providing a degree of predictability and
linkage to good governance practices.</p>
<p>The key to great Agile delivery is not to try and know everything up
front before committing to something, but to know just enough that
the risk profile is understood. Key risks can then be managed and
surprises during delivery avoided. This requires properly configured and
experienced teams, supported by sufficient, lightweight processes.</p>
<h3 id="a-brief-overview-of-agile">A Brief Overview of Agile</h3>
<p>The set of principles and practices that the industry has come to know
as Agile ways of working have been around for some time. The underlying
concepts can be traced back to software development methodologies
such as XP, RUP and Scrum that originated in the 1990s.</p>
<p>We can look even further back to parallels in manufacturing, research
and development practices such as Toyota’s Lean manufacturing or
Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works.</p>
<p>Written in 2001, the Agile Manifesto has come to codify and act as a
rallying point for similar philosophies and ways of working.</p>
<p>The Agility Challenge 23</p>
<p><strong>Figure 1-1: The Agile Manifesto</strong></p>
<p>24 The Agility Challenge</p>
<p>A common misconception is that Agile working supports extremes
of behaviour, such as the abandonment of processes, plans and
documentation. The Manifesto itself states that this is not the case (as
it attributes value to the items on the right) and some of the authors of
the Manifesto have gone on record to suggest that it primarily indicates
a weighting or preference to guide behaviour when constrained or
operating at edge cases.</p>
<p>Agile is not a process or methodology in itself, but rather a philosophy
and an umbrella term for an expanding number of frameworks and
practices that share common principles and values. Irrespective of
the methodologies adopted, organisations or teams that succeed in
embracing Agile working share many traits, including:</p>
<p><strong>○ A focus on satisfying the customer’s needs</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Value derived through end deliverables rather than
intermediate artefacts</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Iterative working with tight feedback loops</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ ‘Necessary and Sufficient’ ceremonies and documentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Anticipation and acceptance of change</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Elimination of overheads/waste</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Concurrent working over consecutive working</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Early (and continuous) focus on quality</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Minimisation of independent silos of practice, knowledge
or control</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Introspection and continuous improvement.</strong></p>
<p>The Agility Challenge 25</p>
<p>Although Agility may not necessarily directly improve straight-line
delivery speed, the elimination of unnecessary work, focus on small
deliveries, maximisation of concurrency and emphasis on delivery of
customer value will often yield a significant performance improvement
for many teams.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, a number of these concepts originate from
outside of software development, and as a result, many of them are
relevant to the wider organisation. Agile is no longer a term that can be
applied exclusively to software.</p>
<h2 id="bjss-opinion">BJSS Opinion</h2>
<h3 id="the-value-triangle">The Value Triangle</h3>
<p>In earlier editions of this book, we discussed the concept of the iron
triangle for a software development project. This considers the triple
constraint of scope, time and cost, and the challenge of meeting all
three simultaneously to create a quality outcome.</p>
<p>We recently updated this diagram to address a broader triple constraint
facing organisations, particularly the technology function - the Value
Triangle. This challenges CIOs to deliver technology predictably, with low
risk, whilst retaining organisational flexibility and Agility, reducing costs
and delivering value for money.</p>
<p>The Value Triangle is shown in <strong>Figure 1-2</strong> and is something we address
throughout this book.</p>

<h3 id="becoming-a-more-agile-organisation">Becoming a More Agile Organisation</h3>
<p>Organisations must become more Agile - to embrace change, innovate
and be more responsive to user needs.</p>
<p>This book offers practical insights into organisation, processes, and
techniques to deliver change and technology-led products. It is worth
noting that becoming a more Agile organisation is an ongoing journey,
not a one-off activity, and so we do not offer a prescriptive target
operating model for the organisation.</p>
<p>Embracing change requires good working practices, with feedback
loops for continuous improvement, and a supportive culture and values
system for the people involved. Organisations that combine these
essential ingredients will thrive.</p>
<h3 id="change-often">Change Often</h3>
<p>Becoming a flexible organisation involves becoming comfortable with
change as a routine activity. This is good for the organisation as it
enables it to be responsive to customer needs and more readily realise
value from those relationships.</p>
<p>Change can be unsettling for the people involved, but we believe it is
worth learning to embrace this and using a culture and values system
to support individuals in feeling secure in an organisation that regularly
innovates and adapts.</p>
<p>Another barrier to frequent change is often an aversion to the ‘risk’ of
technology change. This generally becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Due to the perceived risk of technology changes, rigorous approval gates
and associated process overhead are mandated in an attempt to reduce
the risk of failure. This high ‘release tax’ ensures change is less frequent
and, as a consequence, more changes are put into each release.</p>
<p>28 The Agility Challenge</p>
<p>Bigger changes of course carry a greater risk of failure. Modern DevOps
and Continuous Delivery techniques can help break this cycle.</p>
<h3 id="overcoming-potential-barriers-to-agility">Overcoming Potential Barriers to Agility</h3>
<p>Moving towards a more Agile organisation, one able to rapidly embrace
change, isn’t without challenges, but the benefits are worthwhile.
Recent innovations in technology and delivery approaches have provided
mechanisms for surmounting many of the traditional barriers to
organisational Agility. Throughout this book, we offer some insights into
how to overcome some of the typical challenges.</p>
<p>The Agility Challenge 29</p>
<h2 id="the-enterprise-agile-approach">The Enterprise Agile Approach</h2>
<h3 id="built-on-experience">Built on Experience</h3>
<p>As a supplier that values long term client relationships and organic
growth, we recognise the importance of delivering on our commitments.
To do this, we have developed the approach described in this book.
Enterprise Agile is what we believe ‘good looks like’ in terms of
implementing technology change and running technology services. The
ideas, processes and philosophy outlined here are embodied in the work
we do for us to be successful as a supplier and for our clients to realise
the value of their investment.</p>
<p>A focus on delivery is embedded in our psyche. Many evangelists
theorise about how to deliver change and technology initiatives. We
have written this book based on practical experience and insights and
lessons learned from delivering hundreds of projects over more than 28
years to a broad range of clients in sectors as diverse as Public Sector,
Health and Social Care, Retail and Consumer Markets, Financial Services,
and Energy, Commodities and Utilities.</p>
<p>This perspective is an important dimension that is often missed from
other texts on Agility. If your vendor model is not aligned to enterprise
architecture and the delivery model, significant issues are likely.
Organisational tensions and politics arising from misaligned goals will
adversely impact the delivery of effective change.</p>
<p>Most organisations of any scale work with multiple suppliers to deliver
all or part of their operational business processes, customer engagement
and technology. It is only when supplier incentives and vendor
management are consistent with the organisational goals, architecture
and delivery model, that true Agility is possible.</p>
<p>30 The Agility Challenge</p>
<h3 id="founding-principles">Founding Principles</h3>
<p>Successfully delivering change is first and foremost about people.
Whatever the change initiative, the outcome will be determined
by bringing people on the journey and engaging high-ability teams
to deliver.</p>
<p>Supporting the teams delivering services are the lightweight patterns,
processes, technology and tooling that we describe.</p>
<p>To guide any change initiative, we focus closely on two key components:</p>
<p><strong>○ Insight</strong> - Into the needs of the user and the marketplace</p>
<p><strong>○ High-Quality Deliverables</strong> - To underpin and de-risk the delivery.</p>
<p>Ultimately the goal of any change initiative is to create value for the
organisation. Delivering business and technological change must be
guided by insight and sound discipline. Supporting this are several
essential principles:</p>
<p><strong>○ Risk-First</strong> - Prioritising change based on risk profile</p>
<p><strong>○ Sustainability</strong> - Building resilient solutions that can easily support
change well into the future</p>
<p><strong>○ Quality Built-in</strong> - Embedding quality from the outset</p>
<p><strong>○ Transparency</strong> - Clarity throughout the delivery process</p>
<p><strong>○ Innovation</strong> - Thinking beyond the usual solution</p>
<p><strong>○ ‘Necessary and Sufficient’</strong> - Doing just enough of the right things</p>
<p><strong>○ Rigour and Control</strong> - Knowing where you are and what’s left to do.</p>
<p>The Agility Challenge 31</p>
<h2 id="where-to-go-next">Where to go Next</h2>

<p>36 Organisational Agility</p>
<p>Organisations are seeking greater Agility to thrive in a rapidly
changing world where delivering value to customers is key.
Meeting this challenge requires updated thinking on how to build
and run technology, and how to weave this new approach into
the organisational fabric.</p>
<p>Greater Agility requires a combination of the right people,
supported by the organisational culture and values, lightweight
processes, and appropriate tools. We start by exploring
some of these key components and the essential things
that enable Agility.</p>
<h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2>
<h3 id="technology-at-the-heart-of-the-organisation">Technology at the Heart of the Organisation</h3>
<p>Organisations have historically imposed functional divides within their
internal structure. There is, of course, a need to group people and
processes in an organisation of any reasonable scale. The challenge as
organisations grow is that people can develop an affinity to their job
function at the expense of the delivery of business value through the
product or service they provide.</p>
<p>Enabling true organisation-wide Agility requires a rethink of what
organisations look and feel like. The established view of IT as an
internal service provider, separate from ‘the business’ requires
re-examination. Technologies can no longer be seen as merely useful
tools provided by the IT department to help businesses execute
their processes. To deliver innovative digital services, all modern
organisations need technology at their core. The successful modern
organisation is, fundamentally, a technology organisation operating in
a particular domain.</p>
<p>Organisational Agility 37</p>

<pre><code>‘<span class="hljs-keyword">Business’ </span>Domain Specialists
</code></pre><pre><code>‘<span class="hljs-keyword">IT’ </span>Technology Specialists
</code></pre><p>Now more than ever, CIOs need to understand how technology can add
value to the organisation while CMOs need to understand what it can
offer customers. To meet these challenges, many organisations have
appointed a CDO (Chief Digital Officer), a move which is proving to be
pivotal in driving digital strategies forward. But this is only one piece
of the Agile puzzle. A deeper cultural and structural shift is required to
transform into a truly Agile organisation that can rapidly deliver change.</p>
<p>We explore culture and organisation in more detail in <strong>Chapter 4</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 2-1: Organisational Convergence</strong></p>
<p>38 Organisational Agility</p>
<h3 id="multi-speed-it">Multi-Speed IT</h3>
<p>Delivering new and innovative digital services will not typically be a
greenfield adventure. Unless you are a start-up or a relatively young
organisation, you will already have mature back-office systems, legacy
technology, and a wealth of experience around your customer needs
and business processes. The challenge is to leverage existing knowledge
and systems to change rapidly - without being constrained by a lack of
elasticity in the legacy world.</p>
<p>Many people have already considered this dilemma and produced a
variety of models to allow for varying rates of change. Much of this
thinking is based on the concept of shearing layers - the different
refresh rates of the components of a building: ‘site, structure, skin,
services, space and stuff’. The site on which a building is placed is fixed
forever. The structure of a building is expected to last tens of years,
whilst the services, layout and décor will change more frequently.</p>
<p>The use of shearing layers is adopted by the architectural principle of
pace layering that designs buildings with future adaptability in mind.</p>
<p>Organisational Agility 39</p>
<p><strong>Figure 2-2: Gartner Pace Layering</strong></p>
<p>Pace layering was introduced into the technology domain by Gartner.
Within the technology model, it is acknowledged that different
systems can evolve at different speeds based on their proximity to
the end-customer and the need for innovation.</p>
<p>The idea of multi-speed technology change was also popularised
by Geoffrey Moore, who proposed that rapidly changing systems of
engagement could be used to fuel innovation and develop new services
with more stable systems of record as foundations.</p>

<p>40 Organisational Agility</p>
<p>These models can be thought of as multi-lane highways with a different
velocity of change in each lane. Both models highlight two key points
that we will return to several times throughout this book:</p>
<p>**1. There is no ‘one size fits all’ delivery approach</p>
<ol>
<li>Appropriate architecture is essential.**</li>
</ol>
<p>The point on architecture is important - it is a critical ingredient in
supporting one of the core values of Enterprise Agile - sustainability
and the ability to easily support change well into the future. You can
only achieve this proposed separation of layers if your technology stack
supports it.</p>
<p>This is where well-defined APIs and service layers become essential.
The use of these interfaces allows work to start while decisions on UI,
database, and inter-service communication are yet to be made – which,
in turn, demonstrates business value to customers early. Delivering value
to the customer at the earliest opportunity can mean the difference
between a customer-led success story and a technology-centric project
that failed to deliver.</p>
<h3 id="the-product-portfolio">The Product Portfolio</h3>
<p>The concept of portfolio management dates back to the 1970s. Whereas
projects and programmes are temporary structures that deliver change,
a portfolio is an enduring model of the applications in the organisation
and is used to direct investment.</p>
<p>The product portfolio thus represents the technology delivery that the
organisation is undertaking to deliver its strategy. Combining the product
portfolio with a tool such as the McFarlan Matrix allows an organisation
to track how individual initiatives contribute to each strategic goal.</p>
<p>Organisational Agility 41</p>
<p><strong>Figure 2-4</strong> shows an example of the McFarlan Matrix of Portfolio
Categorisation, which provides four basic classifications of application.</p>
<p>Complementing a portfolio view of applications is the ITIL (information
technology infrastructure library) service portfolio or catalogue. Similarly,
this describes the services provided by a technology function often
related to the support of the application portfolio. Within the modern
organisation, a portfolio management approach is still relevant, although
separation of applications and services is likely to be replaced by a
common view of the technology-led products provided to internal and
external user communities.</p>

<h3 id="innovation-as-a-catalyst-for-agility">Innovation as a Catalyst for Agility</h3>
<p>All organisations are looking to change at an increasing pace to meet the
Agility challenge set out in <strong>Chapter 1</strong>. Whilst start-ups have a perceived
advantage over established organisations with significant legacy
technology and processes, this perception may not always hold true.
Whilst it is often true that being small can make change easier, the key
factor is not size, or being new - it is <strong>innovation</strong>.</p>
<p>Many established organisations can find it hard to innovate, having
spent considerable time and effort optimising their organisations for
operational efficiency. This optimisation does not create an environment,
nor encourage the behaviours required, for innovation. Nobody
could argue against the need for innovation - just look at the fall of
Blockbuster and the rise of Netflix, or the decline of Blackberry and
Nokia as dominant forces in the mobile phone market, and the success
of Apple and Samsung.</p>
<p><strong>But what is innovation, and how can all organisations embrace it?</strong></p>
<p>Some organisations embrace the concept of innovation labs, which are
deliberately distanced from the core organisation, as a mechanism to
generate new ideas for products and services. For others, innovation is
built into the fabric of the firm.</p>
<p>To foster innovation, the critical ingredients are the right behaviours
and skills combined with Lean thinking and a culture that supports
risk-taking.</p>
<p>Organisational Agility 43</p>
<p>One model that describes the characteristics of innovation is the
Harvard definition of the Innovator’s DNA, as illustrated in <strong>Figure 2-5</strong>.
Adopting these behaviours is an essential part of making innovation work
in any organisation.</p>

<h3 id="taking-a-product-or-project-perspective">Taking a Product or Project Perspective</h3>
<p>How an organisation delivers change is largely driven by the perspective
of the products provided. Where ‘run’ the organisation and ‘change’ the
organisation are distinct activities, full organisational Agility cannot be
achieved. In this traditional model, the vehicle for delivering change is
the project. Some organisations can take a product perspective and see
both operating and enhancing a product as ‘business as usual’ activities.
Within this model, the capacity of the Product Team dictates the speed
at which change is delivered.</p>
<p>Key to whether an organisation takes a product or project perspective is
often governance and funding. Run activities are typically funded from
operational expenditure, while change is usually a capital investment.</p>
<p>Using projects and programmes as containers for change is not
necessarily a bad thing. It can be useful for getting to an initial product
launch, for example. Nonetheless, there are significant benefits to
breaking down barriers between ‘change’ and ‘run’ teams, and having a
combined, retained Product Team.</p>
<p>The most obvious downside to projects is that they are temporary
structures. Considerable energy (and associated expense) is required
to form a team that becomes a productive, coherent unit. This
time-consuming and expensive process is then repeated for the
next project.</p>
<p>Organisations should start thinking about change as business as usual
rather than as a discrete project activity. In a product-led organisation,
once the investment in creating a team has been made, the organisation
is in a position to reap the long-term benefits from that investment.</p>
<p>Organisational Agility 45</p>
<h2 id="bjss-opinion">BJSS Opinion</h2>
<h3 id="the-hierarchy-of-concerns">The Hierarchy of Concerns</h3>
<p>To build a model of what ‘good’ looks like, it is useful to dimension
the solution space in several ways. A good starting point is to consider
the hierarchy of responsibilities and activities in product delivery.
Progressing through successive levels reveals further detail and a
lower level of granularity.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 2-6</strong> identifies four key layers: the organisation, the portfolio,
the product, and the Delivery Team. Our model is constructed on the
premise that organisations operate one or more portfolios of products
they wish to build upon. The focus at the organisation level is on
strategy, funding and governance.</p>
<p>Beneath the organisation layer sits the portfolio(s) containing the
individual products that serve users and customers. Each of these
products is typically technology-enabled and requires focused
leadership to ensure they operate and change in a way that delivers
value to the organisation.</p>
<p>Finally, the lowest layer deals with the day-to-day work of the
Delivery Team and the implementation and support of technology
and business change.</p>

<h3 id="organisation-level-activities">Organisation-Level Activities</h3>
<p>The organisation needs to lay out the context and framework within
which Product Teams can deliver value. Ultimately, the organisation
needs to establish a strategy, and set goals and a roadmap. This process
will be most effective when there is a feedback loop. This insight will
come from Product Teams and will always be guided by information
relating to the success of current products, user needs, and general
movement in the market.</p>
<p>A complete discussion of business strategy and marketing is beyond the
scope of this book. It is important to reflect on the attributes of strategy
and organisational-level constraints that influence the work of Product
Teams in delivering change and operating effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy and Roadmap</strong></p>
<p>We expect there to be a forward vision for the direction of the
organisation and its implications for the products and services offered.
The organisation’s strategy will address the markets it is targeting, and
the range of products and services on offer.</p>
<p>Product Teams should be empowered to deliver against this strategy by
maximising value through evolving their product to meet ever-changing
user needs. A broad roadmap for the organisation should highlight the
introduction of new products into the portfolio, or the retirement and
replacement of legacy ones.</p>
<p><strong>Culture and Values</strong></p>
<p>The adoption of Agile is frequently misinterpreted as simply the adoption
of a new set of practices and events. However, to truly evolve from a
‘traditional’ organisation to an Agile one, a fundamental change in the
entire mindset of the organisation is often required.</p>
<p>48 Organisational Agility</p>
<p>The organisation’s culture and values should support the work of
the Product Teams and enable them to operate as autonomously
as possible. The tone and behaviours of the team and its ability to
collaborate effectively towards delivery should be reinforced by
the organisation.</p>
<p>A challenge we often see is when multiple suppliers are engaged in
support of a Product Team, or parts of the organisation are outsourced.
Ideally, you would want all suppliers collaborating towards the common
goal of delivering the most advantageous change for the customer. This
requires not only the correct sourcing strategy, but we also recommend
that all supplier staff are aligned to the culture and values of the
host organisation.</p>
<p><strong>Sourcing and Supplier Strategy</strong></p>
<p>The approach taken to the use of suppliers by an organisation and the
strategy for the use of internal and external teams plays a pivotal role in
the success of any product. We believe that good delivery is ability-led
and relies on having strong people in key roles. The procurement and
utilisation of the right people for the job is a critical success factor.</p>
<p>All too often, procurement functions have been given objectives by the
organisation that do not align with the objectives of the Product Teams.
Ultimately, all functions in the organisation should be focused on the
common goal of delivering customer value. Collaboration and effective
working across the supply chain are the keys to Agility, and a balance is
required such that the commercial interests of all parties are preserved.</p>
<p>Where a Product Team wishes to make use of external products or
services, it is recommended that support from procurement or vendor
management is embedded within the team. By including the vendor
management function within the Product Team, supplier performance
management can be more relevant within the context of the work
being undertaken.</p>
<p>Organisational Agility 49</p>
<p><strong>Cloud Migration</strong></p>
<p>Moving to the Cloud can be a key enabler for business Agility. However,
many organisations fail to unlock the full value, allowing Cloud migration
to become a technical activity, and not considering the impact on the
full operating model in advance.</p>
<p>The best starting point is to understand the current maturity of the
business with Cloud, followed by a design phase to drive the optimum
operating model that suits this competence. We have found the
following patterns to be extremely useful for building Cloud readiness,
as shown in <strong>Table 2-1.</strong></p>

<p>Organisational Agility 51</p>
<h3 id="enterprise-architecture">Enterprise Architecture</h3>
<p>In an organisation of any reasonable scale, we expect to see some form
of enterprise architecture function. This group needs to provide a clear
set of lightweight constraints and guidance that enable Product Teams
to operate and deliver change. There is a clear balance to be struck.
We are not in favour of ivory towers and overly prescriptive corporate
standards that get in the way of Agility.</p>
<p>The enterprise architecture function operates best as a two-way
dialogue and as a group that coaches and supports Product Teams,
rather than simply passing down standards. The key reason for this
function is to help the organisation move forward at pace rather than
hold it back. To this end, enterprise architecture should primarily be
about providing guidance. This will enable the experience from
past lessons learned to benefit the team, rather than simply
enforcing standards.</p>
<p>Certain strategic goals in the organisation may require support from the
enterprise architecture function. It may be necessary, for example, to
re-platform technology to introduce new levels of interoperability across
a range of products. This type of broader organisation initiative will
require overarching architectural support.</p>
<p>52 Organisational Agility</p>
<p>Several enterprise architecture models exist, and their coverage is
beyond the scope of this book. It is useful to draw attention to the core
elements that we expect the function to cover. The four key components
are business architecture, information architecture, application
architecture, and technology architecture as shown in <strong>Figure 2-7</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>Application Custom built <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> off-the-shelf <span class="hljs-keyword">package</span>

<p>The enterprise architecture function will only cover the lightweight
standards around these areas. Most of the specific detail will come from
the solution architecture for specific products.</p>
<p>Organisational Agility 53</p>
<h3 id="governance-and-funding">Governance and Funding</h3>
<p>Funding the initiatives described in the product portfolio will be decided
by how they contribute to the overall strategic aims of the organisation.</p>
<p>Funding will normally be allocated through an annual planning process.
While this does not support a fully Agile model, it corresponds to a
related need to report financial results to shareholders. This is often a
real-world constraint that cannot be changed.</p>
<p>Through an appropriate governance process, it is possible that funding
across the portfolio may be allocated more dynamically. However,
this is unlikely to work for large-scale capital investment projects.
A common route to funding change is allocating a budget to individual
products. This effectively sets a resource capacity that product
owners are empowered to use as they see fit to maximise value for
the organisation.</p>
<p>A lightweight but effective governance process should sit between
the broader organisation and the Product Teams. Governance should
effectively draw together stakeholders from architecture, delivery
management and product ownership to ensure proper alignment and
decision making. Where relevant, it is likely vendor management or
suppliers would also be represented. We cover governance in more
detail in <strong>Chapter 5</strong>.</p>

<p>Enterprise IT has undergone several technological evolutions over

containerisation have all driven architectural change.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 2-8: Technological Evolutions</strong></p>
<p>Organisational Agility 55</p>
<p>In each case, technological change has enabled organisations to drive
efficiencies and enable innovation but not without some significant
internal changes. Cloud has been no different.</p>
<p>To fully realise the benefits of Cloud computing, organisations need
to change their approach to people, processes, and culture.</p>
<p>Some of the key changes that are introduced by Cloud include:</p>
<p><strong>1. Cloud computing transforms spending from a capital expense for</strong>
    <strong>on-premises and co-located IT infrastructure to a pay-as-you-go</strong>
    <strong>utility billing model for Cloud resources and services.</strong> This has not
    been an issue for Agile ‘born-in-the-Cloud’ organisations but has
    a significant impact on more traditional enterprises with legacy
    estates and existing investment in data centres
<strong>2. On-demand Cloud computing offers scope for huge reductions. In</strong>
    <strong>the time it takes to provision infrastructure, engineers can deploy</strong>
    <strong>entire enterprise stacks across multiple environments at the push</strong>
    <strong>of a button.</strong> For the first time, engineers have access to seemingly
    limitless resources and the associated potential for uncontrolled
    expenditure. Establishing deployment controls and the visibility of
    costs is imperative
<strong>3. To fully realise the benefits of Cloud services, organisations must</strong>
    <strong>instill infrastructure change management processes to align</strong>
    <strong>with Agile software development practices such as continuous</strong>
    **monitoring and continuous delivery</p>
<ol>
<li>Cloud TCO requires a more nuanced analysis than previous models.<strong>
 </strong>The impact of a Cloud implementation on the business requires<strong>
 </strong>consideration of the ‘soft’ benefits of Cloud adoption as well as<strong>
 </strong>the spend.** These benefits are often hidden and include increased
 developer productivity, reuse of services, and architectural patterns
 which, in turn, lead to increased throughput of delivery and
 improved quality.</li>

<h3 id="mapping-the-portfolio">Mapping the Portfolio</h3>
<p>The system landscape in many organisations is often quite complex.
Mapping the portfolio can be undertaken in many ways depending on the
view required. The decision as to the appropriate approach is informed
by the desired rate of change and the criticality of the system, as
illustrated in <strong>Figure 2-9</strong>.</p>

<p>Mapping out the organisation’s portfolio of products and services in this
way can be very helpful. It allows the organisation to take a view on
where investment should go, and also advise as to the types of teams
and suppliers to apply. <strong>Figure 2-10</strong> introduces some broad categories
of approach.</p>

<h2 id="the-enterprise-agile-approach">The Enterprise Agile Approach</h2>
<h3 id="components-of-the-technology-landscape">Components of the Technology Landscape</h3>
<p>In our approach, we recommend that modern organisations embrace
several concepts within the technology space. The underlying culture
and values of the organisation support these components and guide all
behaviours and decision making.</p>

</code></pre><p>Organisational Agility 59</p>
<p>At the core of technology delivery are the strategic and supporting
functions of Innovation, Governance, Methods, and Tooling. These
functions serve to determine the direction and provide oversight on
delivery and are often combined into the ‘Office of the CIO’.</p>
<p>Delivering change and supporting the technology products of the
organisation is the remit of Product Engineering Teams. These teams are
aligned to particular products, and are principally concerned with the
delivery and maintenance of software.</p>
<p>Platform engineering provides the underlying infrastructure on which
products are run. For many organisations, this will be a public or private
Cloud solution. The platform will usually be presented to Product Teams
as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) or Platform as a Service (PaaS),
allowing them to code against APIs and self-provision infrastructure,
removing a traditional blocker to Agility - long infrastructure lead times.</p>
<h3 id="the-innovation-lab">The Innovation Lab</h3>
<p>An Innovation Lab is useful for facilitating Agility in the organisation.
Some organisations may have dedicated Innovation Labs, others may
spin one up for a short period, or bring in a third party to facilitate one
for them. In either case, Innovation Labs can be fully remote or have a
dedicated physical working space.</p>
<p>Either way, the key point is that the lab has a Lean process for
generating innovative technology-led business ideas. Its purpose is to
create a business idea that may be developed further into a product
within the organisation’s portfolio.</p>

and align with organisational goals and desired outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 2-12: The Ideation Process</strong></p>
<p>Organisational Agility 61</p>
<h3 id="hackathons">Hackathons</h3>
<p>A Hackathon is a useful tool to enable Agility and idea generation around
a specific problem. Taking place over one or two days, a Hackathon has
a single objective, usually to produce a basic functioning solution to
a given problem. The team, ideally formed from different disciplines,
attempts to address the objective either as a competition - with
multiple teams attempting to solve the same problem - or collectively
as a single group.</p>
<p>The competitive approach allows alternative options to be explored with
left-field solutions that may not normally be considered. Due to the
fixed timescale, the focus is on addressing the problem and not creating
a production-ready deliverable. Indeed, the emphasis is on innovation
and exploration. Enterprise Agile provides the appropriate Hackathon
structure, through Stand-ups and Show and Tells, which are used to
share information as the event progresses. Mini-Sprints, that might only
last three hours, can be used to explore and potentially discard ideas.</p>
<p>The Hackathon should ring-fence the attendees from their day-to-day
tasks, with everyone being co-located - often off-site - to ensure there
are no distractions. Allowing a team to focus on a problem this way can
be very liberating. A Hackathon can act as an interesting introduction
to concepts such as DevOps, with members from different disciplines
working together, demonstrating how the removal of traditional barriers
between development and operations can open up new Agility.</p>
<p>The advent of the Cloud allows Hackathons to be undertaken without
the need for purchasing hardware or software licences and can leverage
free trials provided by the various Public Cloud vendors. This allows
teams to evaluate options and services very quickly.</p>

<p>64 A Pattern for Delivering Value</p>
<p>Our aim with this book is to highlight good practice for using
Agility to introduce and enhance technology products. In
the opening chapters, we explored the challenges facing
organisations and the rationale for our approach. In this chapter,
we describe the patterns and practices for delivering value.</p>
<p>No ‘one size fits all’ methodology or approach is appropriate
to every change initiative. Rather, one of several common
approaches can be adapted to suit the needs of the organisation,
framed by a supportive culture and values system.</p>
<p>Increasing organisational Agility is a journey and is not achieved
by rigidly implementing a new operating model. Success comes
from embracing Agile techniques and an Agile mindset.</p>
<h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2>
<h3 id="the-evolution-of-agile-methods">The Evolution of Agile Methods</h3>
<p>What we now describe as ‘Agile methods’ began appearing in the early
1990s, before the Agile Manifesto. These early methods focused on
developing individual software applications in isolation. Born out of
the frustration of working in a process-heavy environment, software
engineers sought a more effective way of working closely with users to
develop the software they needed.</p>
<p>Many of these early methods eschewed all process and were often
criticised for letting software projects become ‘developer playgrounds’
with insufficient formality for enterprise-scale change initiatives. This
frustration with early attempts at Agile led us to develop the Enterprise
Agile approach. We aimed to help clients enjoy the benefits of greater</p>
<p>A Pattern for Delivering Value 65</p>
<p>flexibility and efficiency, whilst retaining predictability and achieving a
‘No surprises endgame’ for delivery projects.</p>
<p>Recent developments have seen the growth of scaled Agile approaches
that seek to address larger change initiatives. Whilst some of these
are gaining traction, they are still largely software-focused and do not
always link effectively to organisation governance and business change.</p>
<p><strong>XP</strong></p>
<p>Extreme Programming (XP) is an early Agile methodology dating back
to the late 1990s. It identifies twelve practices and several supporting
activities, values and principles. Most commonly known for pair
programming, XP also promoted practices such as programmer welfare
through development at a sustainable pace.</p>
<p>Whilst not often applied in a textbook fashion, some of the core
elements of XP remain at the heart of Agile delivery, notably continuous
integration and test-driven development. A criticism of XP is that it is
best suited to small teams and does not scale effectively.</p>
<p><strong>(R)UP</strong></p>
<p>The Unified Process (UP) refers to the generic process that was
popularised as the Rational Unified Process (RUP) after the commercial
toolset of that name and to a lesser extent in the Open Source version,
Open UP. The key elements of UP are a project lifecycle comprising four
phases: Inception, Elaboration, Construction and Transition.</p>
<p>The previous version of Enterprise Agile extended several UP principles
including a focus on risk and architecture, with iterative and incremental
delivery. The strong link between UP and the RUP toolset caused many
to think it was a commercial methodology requiring the toolset and was
in part a factor in its declining usage.</p>
<p>66 A Pattern for Delivering Value</p>
<p><strong>Scrum</strong></p>
<p>Also originating in the 1990s, Scrum is what many people will recognise
as a common Agile approach. Scrum provides definitions of roles,
events and artefacts, many of which have entered common parlance
and some of which have been adopted by the Enterprise Agile
approach. Scrum also defines a set of values that are fundamental
to its successful adoption and some of these are also shared by the
Enterprise Agile approach.</p>
<p>Scrum has become a very popular Agile method and has proven
effective, particularly on small scale initiatives. In response to the desire
to take Scrum principles and apply them to larger-scale problems,
newer methods such as Large Scale Scrum (LeSS) and Nexus
have emerged.</p>
<p><strong>LeSS</strong></p>
<p>Large Scale Scrum (LeSS) is an attempt to identify how Scrum can be
scaled effectively across multiple teams working on a shared product.
Formalised in 2005, LeSS combines years of experience in product
development with the principles of Scrum and Lean thinking. Two
variants of LeSS exist - LeSS for up to eight teams and LeSS Huge for
bigger groups. It provides a framework that covers principles, structure,
management, technical excellence and adoption.</p>
<p><strong>Nexus</strong></p>
<p>Described as an “exoskeleton of Scrum”, the Nexus framework is
increasingly used in scaled Agile projects where multiple Scrum Teams
are working on a single product. It can be used alongside the Scrum
Guide to scale Scrum and encourage an integrated effort amongst
multiple development teams working on a common product.</p>
<p>A Pattern for Delivering Value 67</p>
<p><strong>SAFe</strong></p>
<p>The Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) has been through five revisions since
2012 and, through its ‘Big Picture’, illustrates a process for Agile delivery
at scale. SAFe makes a distinction between Team, Programme and
Portfolio and introduces the concept of the ‘Agile Release Train’.</p>
<p>As a method for scaled Agile delivery SAFe has been gaining in
popularity. However, it has faced criticism from the Agile community for
being too rigid. Some also say it lacks the strong customer focus that is
central to the Agile mindset.</p>
<h3 id="devops-and-the-convergence-in-technology">Devops and the Convergence in Technology</h3>
<p>In the early days of Agile software development, it was recognised
that, for effective delivery, the divide between different technology
disciplines such as Developers and Testers needed to be broken down.
Multi-disciplinary teams focused on the common goal of delivering
software that works in a live environment rather than throwing work that
is development complete ‘over the wall’ to the Testers or the Operations
Team. More recently, DevOps practices have advocated bringing together
Development and Technical Operations as a single team responsible for
the traditionally separate activities of building and running a software
system. We address this topic in more detail in <strong>Chapter 8</strong>.</p>
<p>68 A Pattern for Delivering Value</p>
<p><strong>Figure 3-1: Convergence Within Technology Departments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Figure 3-2: Transfer of Methods in DevOps</strong></p>
<p>This convergence is key to achieving savings in the operational side of
the organisation.</p>

<p>As shown in <strong>Figure 3-2</strong> , the adoption of DevOps techniques allows
cohesive teams to efficiently build and run products for their customers.</p>
<p>Software engineering techniques and automation have moved over the
line from project delivery into operations, while service management
techniques have moved back into development. It is the automation
of many error-prone manual processes that reduces the barrier to
rapid change and takes much of the effort out of operating a
technology product.</p>
<h3 id="continuous-delivery">Continuous Delivery</h3>
<p>Regardless of the mechanism for getting change into the hands of
users, during delivery we would always want to divide change into
bite-sized pieces. At the end of each piece, the team reviews where
they are and solicits feedback. Typically, this means working within
time-boxed periods known as ‘Iterations’ or ‘Sprints’ that focus on
delivering measurable outcomes as a result of a set of changes. After
one or more Sprints, the changes are released to the user. This forms
the basis of incremental delivery.</p>
<p>It is also possible that changes are immediately released to the user
independent of each other. This model offers greater flexibility and
is often better suited to small scale change and relatively
mature products.</p>
<p>Continuous delivery is a method of fully automating software production,
quality assurance and deployment using a delivery pipeline through
which software change can flow, enabling deployment into production
at any time.</p>
<p>Irrespective of the overarching delivery pattern adopted, continuous
delivery and the use of repeatable automated processes is powerful and
forms a key part of the Enterprise Agile approach.</p>
<p>70 A Pattern for Delivering Value</p>
<h3 id="cloud-as-an-agile-enabler">Cloud as an Agile Enabler</h3>
<p>It is worth calling out Cloud as a facet of the delivery pattern and
a key enabler of Agility. Agile methods have historically focused on
the production of software. Treatment of infrastructure delivery is
often scant or non-existent. Traditional ‘tin and wires’ infrastructure
provisioning led to project plan dependencies and inhibited Agile ways
of working.</p>
<p>With Cloud, or more specifically software-defined infrastructure,
increments of change to products can include not only the application
software but the corresponding changes to the infrastructure too,
packaged and released simultaneously. This opens up a powerful new
paradigm in systems delivery and enables new architectures based on
lightweight microservices to be easily deployed.</p>
<h3 id="different-change-scenarios">Different Change Scenarios</h3>
<p>In defining our thinking around delivering change, we have explored
several common scenarios that we see regularly and have considerable
experience of. Organisations must address a huge variety of change
initiatives, but we feel these scenarios cover the bulk of the cases.</p>
<p>Frequently occurring initiatives in Business to Business (B2B), Business
to Consumer (B2C) or Government to Citizen (G2C) include:</p>
<p><strong>Web-Scale Platform Evolution</strong></p>
<p>Large modern technology organisations often embrace Agility at scale.
Where they have a single product and no significant legacy, they can
apply Agile methods across the organisation and release change often.
Examples include companies such as Facebook, Spotify, etc.</p>
<p>A Pattern for Delivering Value 71</p>
<p><strong>Change Programmes</strong></p>
<p>Often requiring significant capital investment and business change,
these programmes typically arise as a result of mergers and acquisition,
the need for a platform refresh or the expiration of outsourcing
agreements. The scale of the change, funding model and often ‘big bang’
nature of cutover impacts the level of Agility achieved.</p>
<p>We cover change programmes in more detail in our <strong>Enterprise Agile In
Action paper on Transformation</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Enhancement Projects</strong></p>
<p>Most organisations run projects continuously to enhance the technology
products within their portfolio.</p>
<p>It would be possible to write a whole book on the philosophical point of
‘Is there such a thing as an Agile project?’ Greater Agility is achieved by
releasing often and making value-based decisions on delivery priorities.
This can be at odds with traditional project funding processes which
require an agreed business case upfront.</p>
<p><strong>Greenfield Project</strong></p>
<p>Creating a new, relatively standalone product should be undertaken in
line with Agile ways of working. Feature priorities are addressed based
on user needs and business value to create a Minimum Viable Product
(MVP). Once launched, the MVP can be enhanced incrementally based
on customer feedback.</p>
<p>72 A Pattern for Delivering Value</p>
<p><strong>Proof of Concepts</strong></p>
<p>Small scale PoC work is a prime candidate for Lean and Agile working
methods. With this type of work, a fast feedback loop is a powerful tool
to direct the effort of the team towards the objectives.</p>
<p><strong>Agility in all Scenarios</strong></p>
<p>At a time of transformative new digital technologies and globally
disruptive events, the challenge becomes how to use Agility throughout
the entire organisation to more rapidly and reliably adapt to
shifting client, consumer or citizen demands. It is easy to see why
small-scale changes are good candidates for Agile delivery, particularly
on mature products. The adoption of Agility in larger solutions tends to
be in organisations that have adopted a product (rather than a project)
perspective and have placed technology at the heart of the organisation.</p>
<p><strong>Agility is often lost on large scale change programmes, where several
factors impact the level of Agility:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Funding</strong> – Change programmes typically involve a large capital
    investment that requires a detailed upfront business case and
    scoping exercise
<strong>2. Delivery Model</strong> – It can be difficult to deliver change in small
    pieces, particularly on large programmes that might, for example,
    be replacing a legacy product
<strong>3. Vendor Model</strong> – Where several suppliers are engaged, it is too easy
    to form silos that create barriers to Agility and the end-to-end
    delivery of value
<strong>4. Architecture</strong> – Appropriate architecture is required to enable
    delivery to be decomposed effectively on large programmes.</p>
<p>Within this book and the Enterprise Agile method, we describe
techniques to enable Agile ways of working in all of these scenarios.</p>
<p>A Pattern for Delivering Value 73</p>
<h2 id="bjss-opinion">BJSS Opinion</h2>
<h3 id="releasing-change-to-the-users">Releasing Change to the Users</h3>
<p>Earlier we discussed different types of change initiative and how these
might be delivered through continuous product innovation or discrete
projects. Whenever possible, we want to break down large changes into
smaller, manageable chunks and put them in front of real users to get
feedback. Piecemeal introduction of change allows for regular course
corrections. These subtle direction changes keep the product aligned
with the market and optimise the value derived by the organisation.</p>
<p>The constructs used will depend on two key factors:</p>
<p><strong>1. How the organisation allocates funding and measures</strong>
    **value delivered</p>
<ol>
<li>The process by which change can be delivered to the user.**</li>
</ol>
<p>There are situations when frequent releases are not possible, for
example replacing a legacy trading system - all users need all
functionality and all have to be in the same market – so a big bang
transition is unavoidable.</p>
<p>Ideally, you would want to release change to users often and as small
incremental features, because:</p>
<p>**1. The users benefit from new product features</p>
<ol>
<li>The organisation gains value</li>
<li>The Product Team receives feedback to refine the roadmap</li>
<li>Change becomes a low risk ‘Business as Usual’ activity.**</li>
</ol>
<p>74 A Pattern for Delivering Value</p>
<p>There are, of course, many real-world constraints and differences across
sectors and products. Continuously delivering change to a social media
networking application is likely to be easier than to a commodities
trading platform, for example.</p>
<p>It is worth spending some time exploring the factors that impact release
cycles. Firstly, let’s tackle a key challenge for many organisations –
perceived risk. We purposefully use the term ‘perceived risk’. It is often
a very subjective assessment based on prior experience that may or may
not be relevant. Many organisations unintentionally develop a risk-averse
culture, perhaps based on the reaction to a previous failed release.</p>
<p>Attitude to risk often leads to a self-fulfilling prophecy. Change is
perceived as risky; this results in additional process and a high ‘release
tax’. As a result, changes are made less often and releases become
bigger, and riskier, as a result. The automation and DevOps techniques
we talk about in this book are key to breaking out of this cycle.</p>
<p>A further important determinant of the change cycle is the impact on
the user and other products and services. Where a change involves
new ways of working, new people in new roles and so forth, then more
up-front planning is required. These non-Agile real-world constraints,
such as recruitment and training, get in the way of continuous
change. This can be approached by breaking the work down into
manageable chunks that address specific aspects of the new ways of
working, including subgroups, or even individual new roles, as they
are introduced.</p>
<p>Another category of impact concerns integration with other technology
products, some of which may reside outside of the organisation. In
these circumstances, changes have to be aligned with change in other
upstream or downstream systems. This is why appropriate architecture
is so crucial to achieving Agility. Good enterprise architecture will enable
integration across systems changing at different speeds.</p>
<p>A Pattern for Delivering Value 75</p>
<h3 id="when-large-scale-change-is-unavoidable">When Large Scale Change is Unavoidable</h3>
<p>As discussed, releasing changes to existing products often comes down
to attitude to risk and an assessment of the impact or scale of the
change. One common class of problem is worth exploring further.</p>
<p>Launching a new product involves a large change, particularly if
replacing a legacy system. This situation is often unavoidable, for
example, re-writing an outsourced service that is coming to the end of
the contract.</p>
<p>The functionality for the new product must reach critical mass for it
to be useful - this is often referred to as the Minimum Viable Product
(MVP). There are two transition options - big bang or incremental. With a
big bang approach, all users begin to use the product at the same time
rather than it being introduced to smaller groups of users in phases.</p>
<p>The obvious choice is to avoid big bang due to the risk. However, that
is not without challenge, particularly if modifications are required to
the existing system to run old and new in parallel. Sometimes big bang
is the only option, for example, when users cannot be partitioned in
any way, such as on a trading platform where a single market with
counterparty credit relationships exists. Big bang and incremental rollout
are contrasted in <strong>Table 3-1</strong>.</p>

<p>No single approach, method or target-operating model addresses
all scenarios. Delivering technology and business change is difficult.
The important thing is to consider each scenario and product within
the context of the organisation. For example, unless you are a
technology start-up, you rarely get the opportunity to work in a
legacy-free environment.</p>

<h2 id="the-enterprise-agile-approach">The Enterprise Agile Approach</h2>
<h3 id="a-lifecycle-for-products">A Lifecycle for Products</h3>
<p>We have covered the role of the organisation in operating and changing
products. Any organisation will deliver a range of products and services
to its customers. Whilst there is some variation, most products follow
a similar path in terms of their lifecycle. The Enterprise Agile product
lifecycle is illustrated in <strong>Figure 3-3</strong>.</p>
<p>Technology delivery has historically been split into ‘Build’ and ‘Run’.</p>
<p>Our model can, if required, support Projects and Programmes delivering
change, with the operation of the resultant product undertaken by
technology operations and BAU Teams. Our strong preference, however,
is for combined Product Teams undertaking Build and Run activities.</p>
<p>Rather than immediately focusing on these structures it is worth taking
a step back and looking more holistically at the product lifecycle.</p>
<p>80 A Pattern for Delivering Value</p>
<p>All products require some upfront work to get them to a state where
they are sufficiently defined to start building and then have sufficient
substance to rollout to some or all users. This is the Minimum Viable
Product (MVP).</p>
<p>Once the initial version of the product is launched it will continue to
evolve to meet growing user needs. These post-launch changes may be
small features delivered continuously or, if organisational constraints
make it unavoidable, larger features delivered incrementally by a larger
change project.</p>
<p>Eventually, the product will be retired. This process can be gradual
where users are slowly migrated to a replacement product and all
or part of the original product remains. It can also be a more abrupt
transition when existing services are turned off. This can happen when
an outsourced contract comes to an end.</p>
<p>Within the product lifecycle are several discrete phases. The early
phases prepare the organisation and team for the introduction of a
new product. A key focus in these early stages is to set a course and
reduce risk whilst retaining Agility. The use of these phases allows the
organisation to make investment decisions and informed choices about
delivery options, for example, to build or buy technology components.</p>
<p>The three phases of Feasibility, Discovery and Delivery act as a ‘ready,
aim, fire’ mechanism to prepare the organisation for the commitment
of developing a new product. Each of these phases has several core
objectives and should link to a governance process.</p>
<p>A Pattern for Delivering Value 81</p>
<p><strong>Feasibility</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of the Feasibility phase is to assess how an idea can meet
the needs of the user and generate value for the organisation. This phase
takes an idea and translates it into a more concrete concept that can be
further explored.</p>
<p>At this stage, a small team of specialists will work for a short period
to determine if the idea is sufficiently substantive to warrant
further effort.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery</strong></p>
<p>In essence, Discovery is concerned at a high level with <strong>validating</strong> the
problem to be solved, <strong>how</strong> will it be solved (both solution architecture
and delivery approach), and what <strong>measures</strong> will be put in place to
ensure successful delivery, and a refined delivery <strong>plan</strong>.</p>
<p>The aim of a Discovery phase is to de-risk subsequent delivery and
hone in on the options for implementation. Discovery will not answer all
questions or establish all requirements in detail, but it will establish the
scope for an MVP.</p>
<p>A core Product Team will be formed to undertake Discovery. This process
can last anywhere from a few weeks to two months and results in the
delivery of prototypes or product mock-ups.</p>
<p><strong>Delivery</strong></p>
<p>During the Delivery phase, features of the product are incrementally
delivered based on a roadmap that captures the value released to the
organisation. Beyond launch, the Delivery phase supports and operates
the product for the users.</p>

<h3 id="achieving-mvp-the-no-surprises-endgame-">Achieving MVP – The ‘No Surprises Endgame’</h3>
<p>At the enterprise level, getting to a Minimum Viable Product (MVP),
and therefore delivering tangible value to customers or the business,
for many products involves implementing large-scale change. It is in
this scenario, where large capital investments have been made, that
executives get nervous and look for evidence of predictability in delivery.
It is precisely for this reason that the Feasibility-Discovery-Delivery
pattern is so important as a technique to de-risk delivery.</p>
<p>However, this should not be confused with traditional ‘predictive’
lifecycles such as Waterfall. A balance between upfront and deferred
Discovery must be struck. Just as important as charting a course during
the early phases is evidencing progress in the right direction during
Delivery through a process of incremental acceptance.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 3-4</strong> illustrates how incremental acceptance is achieved by
running through all facets of delivery at regular intervals and validating
the content and quality of the product at each stage. There are two
key parts to this acceptance, firstly that the user needs are being
met (functional acceptance) and secondly that the product performs
adequately and can be operated effectively (non-functional acceptance).</p>
<p>This process of incremental acceptance and the product lifecycle of
Enterprise Agile are key ingredients of the ‘No surprises endgame’ - our
delivery objective for any change initiative.</p>

<h1 id="the-optimal-team">The Optimal Team</h1>
<p>88 The Optimal Team</p>
<p>Effective delivery requires the correct organisation of highly
capable people and the appropriate utilisation of their skills.
Good teams are not made overnight, and this is a considerable
drawback of delivering change in discrete projects. Continuous
delivery of change by a Product Team in an Agile organisation
overcomes some of these challenges.</p>
<p>Being effective also requires that individuals and teams be
supported by the culture and values of the organisation. There is
a difficult balance to strike between empowering teams to make
decisions and being quasi-autonomous, and potentially losing
control as people operate outside the legitimate constraints put
in place by the wider organisation.</p>
<h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2>
<h3 id="the-return-of-the-full-stack-engineer">The Return of the Full Stack Engineer</h3>
<p>When BJSS was established in 1993, it was common for software
engineers to perform the full range of tasks required to deliver a system.
This often included not only cutting code but writing and executing
automated tests, creating build and deployment scripts, and maintaining
development and test environments.</p>
<p>Over the years, the software stack and the array of foundation products,
frameworks and tools available to facilitate the production of a system
have grown dramatically, leading many practitioners to specialise. For
example, larger teams often engage specialists to maintain the build
servers and develop deployment scripts.</p>
<p>The Optimal Team 89</p>
<p>Recently, the term ‘Full Stack Engineer’ has become popular. In our view,
this term describes what good all-round engineers have always done -
have the skill and flexibility to work on all engineering tasks required to
deliver a working solution.</p>
<p>‘Polyglot’ has also recently become a fashionable term to describe a
developer fluent in multiple programming languages. This too is not a
new concept for us. Being skilled in several technologies can be good for
the individual’s career and the flexibility of the organisation but should
be balanced with a desire for in-depth knowledge in a particular field.
Certainly, there are cases where engineering specialism is required, for
example, a DBA role. We discuss what makes a good engineer later in
this chapter.</p>
<p>It is worth saying something about another term we often hear -
‘DevOps Engineer’. This role description can cause some confusion.
DevOps is a cultural and organisational concept rather than a specific
engineering discipline. Often what is meant is working with scripting
technologies to automate the delivery pipeline. Again, this is a task to
which most Full Stack Engineers can turn their hand, although there are
cases where a specialist can be useful. We avoid confusion by using the
term Platform Engineer when referring to infrastructure delivery.</p>
<h3 id="self-optimising-organisations">Self-Optimising Organisations</h3>
<p>One of the barriers to Agility we identified at the start of this book was
dealing with real-world constraints and business change. Examples
of potential challenges here include staff redeployment, training and
recruitment. Some thinking is emerging as to how some of these issues
may be overcome and how to apply Agile principles to organisation
design and business change.</p>
<p>One such example of this is Holacracy, a management system devised
by Brian Robertson. It replaces hierarchy and large organisational change</p>
<p>90 The Optimal Team</p>
<p>with a flat management structure and distributed authority. Whilst in
its infancy, Holacracy is gaining some ground and demonstrates the
desire amongst a variety of organisations to gain competitive advantage
through a more flexible and rapidly changing structure and empowering
people to take control of their work and challenges.</p>
<h2 id="bjss-opinion">BJSS Opinion</h2>
<h3 id="ability-led-versus-process-led">Ability-Led versus Process-Led</h3>
<p>Successful change initiatives are ability-led not process-led. Many
organisations mistakenly rely upon process to drive a quality outcome,
particularly at scale. Whilst process is important, having empowered,
capable individuals in key roles is essential to enabling rapid change
and innovation.</p>
<p>Commoditising or de-skilling technology delivery with excessive process
is fraught with issues. We prefer to build teams from highly capable
individuals with a mix of experience levels and a shared appetite for
delivery success.</p>
<p>The Agile Manifesto reinforces this message by favouring People and
Interactions over Processes and Tools. It should be noted that, as with
all tenets of the Agile Manifesto, this is a preferred bias rather than an
extreme position. Product Teams need to operate within the constraints
of the organisation and maintain a regular, healthy, connected dialogue.</p>
<p>Countering the perception of Agile as a ‘Developer playground’ requires
that the organisation properly aligns teams to goals and implements
the ‘Necessary and Sufficient’ lightweight governance in preference to a
return to command-and-control management.</p>
<p>The Optimal Team 91</p>
<h3 id="a-supportive-culture-and-values-system">A Supportive Culture and Values System</h3>
<p>Product Teams must be appropriately supported by the organisation to
operate effectively. The organisation’s culture and values exist to guide
teams in their daily work, particularly when conflict arises, or difficult
decisions are required.</p>
<p>A healthy organisation will keep the conversation alive through
regular engagement with teams and individuals. Note that, in many
organisations, Product Teams comprise permanent employees,
contingent labour and multiple suppliers. This presents a challenge that
should not be overlooked. We strongly recommend that orientation and,
where necessary, adjustments to team values are made when people are
added to the team.</p>
<p>All individuals should contribute to, identify with, and sign up to
the values of their team and the wider organisation. This simple but
powerful act helps everyone move forward together. It must be clear
that this is not about rigid command and control, but an evolving set of
guiding principles to aid and support teams.</p>
<p>92 The Optimal Team</p>
<h3 id="creating-productive-teams">Creating Productive Teams</h3>
<p>We are often engaged in helping organisations to initiate new projects
and programmes in which teams comprise people who have never
worked together. This is one of the key reasons why projects as a vehicle
for delivering change can be inefficient. It is essential to consider,
particularly in the Leadership Team, the characteristics of the individuals
concerned. We shouldn’t think of people the way we think of personal
computers or desks, as interchangeable components that can be
re-deployed with minimal disruption. Teams and the people within them
have unique characteristics that need to be considered in the formation
and ongoing operation of the team.</p>
<p>Various theories have been offered to describe the dynamics of a team
and how a group develops. Most commonly quoted is Bruce Tuckman,
who initially identified four phases of group development: Forming,
Storming, Norming, Performing. This was later updated to describe a
fifth phase, Adjourning.</p>
<p>Other similar models have been proposed, such as Tubbs’ System
Model (Orientation, Conflict, Consensus, Closure) and Fisher’s theory of
decision emergence (Orientation, Conflict, Emergence, Reinforcement).</p>
<p>These models can be useful to describe the evolution of a team and how
they tackle problems. It is worth taking this into account when planning
and considering the productivity of the team.</p>
<p>The Optimal Team 93</p>
<p><strong>Figure 4-1: Tuckman’s Stages of Group Development</strong></p>
<p>A key contributor to a productive team is clarity of goals and required
outcomes. We passionately believe in keeping teams engaged and aware
of the bigger picture. Team communication begins with Agile events
such as the daily Stand-up, which keeps the team aligned in terms of
challenges and the work of their peers.</p>
<p>Wider team communication should also be encouraged. This will
include community gatherings for individuals interested in particular
disciplines, for example, test automation or user-centred design. We
also recommend that the entire Product Team is gathered together
periodically for a full ‘Town Hall’ meeting. This should happen even if the
team is large to re-assert objectives and allow Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>Social functions are also a key part of getting a team to gel and operate
effectively. The Leadership Team can often be buried in delivery
challenges and forget this essential ingredient for productivity. The
organisation of social functions is best left to someone in the team -
they are often likely to have better ideas and be more enthusiastic about
this aspect than the Management Team.</p>

<h3 id="considerations-for-a-productive-environment">Considerations for a Productive Environment</h3>
<p>The physical environment can have a considerable impact on team
performance. Organisations require spaces that support different
working methods. It must be possible to work quietly and concentrate
on technical tasks. In addition, the environment must allow teams to
collaborate and work together. This support should go beyond traditional
meeting spaces. Allowing for osmotic communication and quick informal
problem-solving as a team or pairing around particular problems helps
keep teams productive and the work flowing.</p>
<p>Haworth’s model for organisational space design reaffirms the
relationship between environment and culture is defined as <strong>Control</strong>
(hierarchy); <strong>Compete</strong> (Market); <strong>Collaborate</strong> (Clan) and <strong>Create</strong>
(adhocracy). The Values Framework can be a helpful tool for assessing
and motivating desirable behaviours through environmental adjustments.</p>
<p>People often ask us about the importance of co-location to delivery,
particularly following the Covid-19 pandemic, which forced many of us
to challenge our preconceptions regarding the effectiveness of remote
teams. In the wake of the pandemic, the option to co-locate was
suddenly removed. Many teams had to adapt their ways of working to
comply with the restrictions imposed.</p>
<p>This sudden shift to remote working generated numerous benefits for
individuals. People gained their time back from not having to commute
to the office. They were able to spend more time with family and
developed new ways of working and communicating through tools
such as Zoom. While remote working has benefits, some colleagues
struggled to adapt, stating that they missed in-person interactions in
the office or had impractical workspaces at home, such as those in
shared accommodation.</p>

<p>As the pandemic began to subside and restrictions were lifted, some
organisations continued working in a remote-first model. Others
gradually reverted to office-based work and some, including ourselves,
transitioned to a ‘hybrid’ (or ‘blended’) working model.</p>
<p>For those organisations continuing to work remotely, our advice is
to, as much as possible, mimic the conditions of a co-located office
environment. For example, the efficiency of frequent face-to-face
communication is invaluable, even if it’s over video conferencing.</p>
<p>We have had much success operating in a hybrid model where
our employees split their time between working in the office and
working remotely. By working in this way, we’ve seen increased people
availability, accelerated ramp-up, greater diversity in opinions and
shared accountability for work across organisational boundaries.</p>
<p>Successful hybrid working patterns depend on an equal balance
between office and remote work. We often hear of organisations
neglecting in-person face-to-face interactions, which can negatively
impact delivery.</p>
<p>From our experience, in-person interactions and meetings still play a
crucial role in helping us achieve better project outcomes and solve
problems more effectively. They also help individuals form relationships
with new team members, particularly in the early ‘forming’ stages. There
is no better way to develop inter-team relationships than socialising
face-to-face.</p>

<h3 id="a-brief-guide-to-organisation-and-teams">A Brief Guide to Organisation and Teams</h3>
<p>To navigate the people and organisational aspects of Enterprise Agile, a
brief overview of key concepts is provided here.</p>
<p>First, let us consider the building blocks of the delivery organisation:</p>
<p><strong>○ Individuals performing specific tasks relating to change and
service delivery - we promote the notion of ‘T-shaped’ individuals</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Delivery and Service Teams, which are highly cohesive teams of
individuals working toward common goals</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ The Product Team, which consists of one or more teams and a
leadership function.</strong></p>
<p>These elements create a scalable method for organising people to
build, maintain and enhance products. An effective leadership function,
comprising Product Ownership, Delivery Management, Solution
Architecture and Service Design Leadership, is at the heart of the
successful Product Team. We will now explore each of these concepts in
more detail.</p>
<h3 id="the-product-team">The Product Team</h3>
<p>The Agile organisation comprises several building blocks aligned to our
hierarchy of concerns. Certain roles are fulfilled at an organisation level,
at a product level and within Engineering and Business Change Teams.
The broad picture of the Product Team and the relationships they have is
shown in <strong>Figure 4-3</strong>.</p>
<p>98 The Optimal Team</p>
<p>At the heart of any Product Team are the four key roles of Product
Owner, Delivery Manager, Solution Architect and Service Design Lead.
These key positions decide what changes are made to the product and
how the ongoing service will be delivered.</p>
<p>This nucleus of the Product Team has the responsibility for managing
the Delivery and Service Teams and the relationship with user groups
and stakeholders. The remainder of the Product Team is responsible for
delivering change and supporting the product.</p>
<p>The Product Team will work closely with the Design Team that may
comprise Service Designers, Visual Designers, Content Producers
and Analysts. The Design Team investigates and interprets pertinent
information to design the optimum product or service. This process
establishes a framework for the Product Manager to own.</p>
<p>The size and specialisms of a Design Team will depend on the
complexity of the overall experience - i.e., how difficult will it be to
motivate desired behaviours, and how challenging or numerous are
the business processes and customer touchpoints to achieve those
behaviours. For particularly complex projects demanding organisational
restructure or multi-faceted orchestration and oversight, a Service
Designer may form part of the core Product Team.</p>

<p>100 The Optimal Team</p>
<p>The basic building block is the ‘T-shaped’ technologist. These individuals
are assembled into cohesive Delivery Teams, with potentially multiple
teams for a particular product.</p>
<p>Most Engineering Teams will be multi-disciplinary and charged with
delivering end-to-end features that meet user needs and add value
to the organisation. General-purpose Feature Delivery Teams may
be supported by specialist Engineering Teams. For example, a
non-functional Test Team providing assurance of the complete
integrated product against the non-functional requirements for the
solution. Care should be taken to avoid these specialist teams becoming
single point dependencies such that they are bottlenecks to the overall
delivery of the product. In these instances, the specialisms should be
integrated into the Delivery Teams so that these teams may continue
to be autonomous. This may be achieved by restructuring the team,
through a formal education programme, or via shadowing.</p>
<p>In addition to Engineering Teams, Service Teams will be required to deal
with customer service enquiries and support the usage of the product
by the organisation and external users.</p>
<p>In the Agile organisation, there are also likely to be Business Change
Teams that update manual processes and execute organisational change.</p>
<h3 id="the-shape-of-the-individual">The Shape of the Individual</h3>
<p>We expect teams to include a diverse range of people. The Product
Team will comprise technologists, domain specialist and managers, in a
coherent unit organised for effective delivery. Most technologists have
some kind of specialism - development, testing, analysis, database
design, etc.</p>
<p>The Optimal Team 101</p>
<p>A common question is to what extent specialists should be used within
technology delivery rather than generalists. Achieving the benefits of
Agility requires a team of people with diverse skills working together
towards a common goal. However, too much specialisation risks creating
silos, inefficiencies and key person dependencies that are hard to
overcome. For technology personnel, we always look for ‘T-shaped’
individuals, as illustrated in <strong>Figure 4-4</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>Delivery <span class="hljs-built_in">Capability</span>

</code></pre><p><strong>Figure 4-4: ‘T-shaped’ Technologists</strong></p>
<p>102 The Optimal Team</p>
<p>At their core, everyone on the team has a passion for delivery, a
solid understanding of Agile principles, and a good engineering
and problem-solving mindset. This core is supported by specialist
technology skills, perhaps in test automation tools or
software-defined infrastructure.</p>
<p>Strong technologists should always be able to learn the next test tool
or programming language. When hiring into teams it is important to
focus on the core attributes of the individual rather than hiring only for
specific technologies.</p>
<p>These same specialised-generalist principles are also applied to
managerial personnel. All managers are expected to have a strong
knowledge of Agile and project and service management principles. In
Enterprise Agile, managers are expected to support delivery, not just
report on it. It is also likely that managers will have a specialism in the
same way that ‘T-shaped’ technologists do. For managers, this may be
expertise in infrastructure delivery or test management; for Service
Design professionals this could be research or information design
and architecture.</p>
<h3 id="the-key-delivery-roles">The Key Delivery Roles</h3>
<p>Certain key roles must be filled for teams to successfully build and run
the product. Depending on the scale of the organisation and product,
not all roles will map to different individuals. Some roles are also quite
broad and in larger organisations will be split across several people.</p>
<p>As we have already discussed, the organisation has a role to play in
setting certain boundaries and constraints for Product Teams as well as
providing support and guidance.</p>

<p>106 The Optimal Team</p>
<p>As we discussed earlier in this chapter, the concept of the ‘T-shaped’
Engineer is nothing new. Typically, it specifies a broad range of
capabilities combined with in-depth knowledge of at least one technical
discipline. This is particularly applicable for the Platform Engineer. The
engineering role has evolved from the requirement for expertise in a
single subject matter, such as networking, to an understanding of the
entire infrastructure stack delivered as software-defined Cloud services.
This has led to the breakdown of boundaries between Infrastructure
Architecture, Infrastructure Design and Infrastructure Deployment,
with the Platform Engineer requiring an understanding of the entire
solution rather than a single subject. In addition, the introduction of
Infrastructure as Code necessitates an understanding of software
development techniques and automation.</p>

</code></pre><p>The Optimal Team 107</p>
<p>Agile Software Engineering has historically been delineated alongside
Development, Test, and Platform Engineering roles. With the introduction
of Infrastructure as Code, these disciplines have moved closer together
and share many principles. In each case, the engineering requires
in-depth discipline and specific knowledge (such as Java, Selenium,
Terraform/AWS), and shares many aspects:</p>
<p><strong>○ A shared codebase</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ The requirement for code quality (including code reviews)</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Consistent change control processes.</strong></p>
<p>There are several organisational benefits to be realised:</p>
<p><strong>1. Cross-training between roles becomes easier, providing</strong>
    **career flexibility</p>
<ol>
<li>Project resourcing challenges can be overcome with<strong>
 </strong>multi-discipline engineers</li>
<li>Improved quality and velocity through consistent approach<strong>
 </strong>across disciplines.**</li>
</ol>
<p>108 The Optimal Team</p>
<h3 id="focused-delivery-teams">Focused Delivery Teams</h3>
<p>The building block of the organisation for delivering technology change
is the Delivery Team. These teams are deliberately constructed cohesive
units working collaboratively towards common goals. There isn’t a
universally applicable formula for the type and number of individuals in
the team, but there are some reasonable guidelines. Typically, we expect
to see Delivery Teams configured such that:</p>
<p><strong>1. One individual can ably support the team - this implies an optimal</strong>
    **team size of about 6-10</p>
<ol>
<li>It includes all the skills required to deliver an increment of<strong>
 </strong>valuable change</li>
<li>All are focused on a common goal – delivery of specified features.**</li>
</ol>
<p>Irrespective of the method, all technology delivery comprises activities
to analyse, develop, test, build and deploy. All of these activities need
to be covered by the individuals within the team. By working together
on the goal of delivering a feature to the user, these teams avoid the
creation of the traditional silo mentality that has historically existed
between functions such as Development and Test.</p>
<p>The Optimal Team 109</p>
<p><strong>Figure 4-5: Example Delivery Team Structure</strong></p>
<p><strong>Figure 4-5</strong> provides an example of a technology Delivery Team with

<h3 id="responsive-service-teams">Responsive Service Teams</h3>
<p>As products increase in scale, it may be necessary to complement the
Delivery Teams in the Product Team with Service Teams that operate
the product and respond to user queries. Each team may contain a
mix of people specialising in dealing with users and resolving incidents.
Where a defect or insight is found, the Service Team passes it to the
Delivery Teams for resolution or enhancement. This proactive approach
uncovers new opportunities for product improvement. In traditional IT
support terms, Service Teams undertake first and second line support,
and Delivery Teams undertake third line support. Service Teams should
include service agents who deal with customers and diagnose basic
issues together with more technical people who may use tools provided
by the Delivery Teams, or the underlying platform, to fix incidents.</p>
<p>As the Product Team scales further, Service Teams may focus on
particular groups of users or parts of the system. As with Delivery Teams,
all the members of Service Teams are focused on a common goal –
providing a great service for users.</p>
<h3 id="effective-team-leadership">Effective Team Leadership</h3>
<p>Getting the right people to lead teams is pivotal to success. There are
two aspects to this which may or may not be filled by one person.
Firstly, a strong lead is required to prioritise the activities of the team,
track progress towards goals, raise issues and remove blockers that
impede delivery.</p>
<p>The second side to leadership is more technically biased, taking a lead
on design, mentoring the team and upholding the constraints and
standards set by the broader organisation. Often the best technologist
in the team is not the right person to perform the former of these roles
but may be suited to the latter.</p>
<p>The Optimal Team 111</p>
<h3 id="organising-change-across-delivery-teams">Organising Change Across Delivery Teams</h3>
<p>When multiple Delivery Teams are engaged in delivering a product, a
decision is required as to how to divide work between them. There are
two schools of thought:</p>
<p><strong>1. The teams could have an affinity with components or parts</strong>
    <strong>of the system</strong></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><strong>2. The teams could be organised around cohesive</strong>
    <strong>end-to-end features that cut across potential technology</strong>
    <strong>or component boundaries.</strong></p>
<p>There isn’t a definitive answer, although we have a strong preference
for feature teams rather than component teams. We often change from
one type of team to the other during a project, starting with component
teams then moving to feature teams later when the basic structure is
in place. There are advantages and disadvantages to each approach, as
outlined in <strong>Table 4-4</strong>.</p>

components across <span class="hljs-keyword">multiple
</span>Product Teams
</code></pre><p><strong>Table 4-4: Team Affinity</strong></p>
<p>A key thing to remember is that success requires alignment of delivery
model, team organisation, architecture and vendor management. If you
engage multiple suppliers and they are providing expertise for specific
elements of the technology stack, feature teams may not be the answer.</p>
<p>Real-world constraints often mean a hybrid model is used in many
organisations. For example, the software vendor may maintain the
back-office operational fulfilment package, while cohesive feature
teams maintain multi-channel customer engagement systems. It is
also possible for the position to move with time as the early stages of
delivering a new product require focused work on frameworks.</p>
<p>The Optimal Team 113</p>
<p>In our experience, wherever there are hand-offs required between teams
to secure end-to-end delivery, a level of coordination is required of each
of the teams involved. Whilst this coordination may be achievable, it will
inevitably create an overhead for each team and may require additional
time and people for the delivery.</p>
<h3 id="scaling-the-model">Scaling the Model</h3>
<p>When the overall Product Team becomes larger than around five Delivery
and Service Teams, it is probably time to think about how to adapt the
structure. Traditional thinking would suggest creating a hierarchy and an
additional layer of management. To an extent, there is no avoiding some
form of organisational structure to coordinate across the growing team,
but any structure should be lightweight and pass the Enterprise Agile
‘Necessary and Sufficient’ test.</p>
<p>Several models have been offered by organisations employing
large-scale Agile delivery techniques. Some organisations employ
terminology such as Individuals or Teams to describe groupings
of teams. In Enterprise Agile, we adopt the more straightforward
nomenclature of Streams and Teams to describe bigger team structures
and organisational containers.</p>
<p>A key driver in our thinking about larger teams is the balance between
empowering people to take ownership of their work and quality of
delivery, and the organisation’s need for some consistency of approach
and easily digestible information on status and progress. A key to
success in larger teams is effective communication. Structured
and formal channels should be supported by informal ad-hoc
communications, enabled by the working environment and suitable
technical and collaboration tools.</p>
<p>114 The Optimal Team</p>
<p>In Enterprise Agile, several key constructs help support the
growing team:</p>
<p><strong>○ Stream</strong> - A group of teams working on related functionality or
components of the system</p>
<p><strong>○ Capability</strong> - A logical grouping of team members undertaking the
same job function</p>
<p><strong>○ Community</strong> - A group of people with similar interests looking to
promote improvements in a particular area.</p>
<h3 id="focused-streams-of-activity">Focused Streams of Activity</h3>
<p>As the number of individual teams grows, they may require some logical
grouping and additional coordination. For this purpose, we use the
term ‘Stream’ to describe a collection of related teams. Teams may be
grouped by function such as Delivery, Service and Business Change, by
functional area or by technical component. There are clear advantages
to each, but our preference is for functional area first and technical
component second. We are keen to avoid silos and promote the
concept of tightly bound teams working toward common goals based on
delivering customer value. To be successful, the organisation of Streams
should align with the technical architecture and any supplier model
and incentives.</p>
<p>When there are several Streams each with many teams, it may be
necessary to replicate the Product Leadership function across each
Stream. This ensures that there is sufficient delivery management,
solution architecture and product management bandwidth to coordinate
and lead the work of the team as illustrated in <strong>Figure 4-6</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="leading-consistency-through-capabilities">Leading Consistency Through Capabilities</h3>
<p>When multiple teams exist, it is useful to lead the work of the same job
function across these teams. For example, a test capability may exist to
group together the Testers across several teams and share best practice,
ways of working and tools. A Test Lead may span the teams and provide
guidance, support, best practice on working methods, and a lightweight
governance function.</p>
<p>This secondary alignment of the individual to a Capability, in addition
to the primary role of delivering as part of the team, provides a useful
structure to support people in their daily work. The use of Capabilities is
illustrated in <strong>Figure 4-7</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="building-communities-for-continuous-improvement">Building Communities for Continuous Improvement</h3>
<p>If, as we suggest, technologists are located within Delivery Teams tied
to products, then we hope that their primary affinity is to the product.
Whilst this achieves focus on product delivery, it is important for both
the organisation and the individual that there is a broader fabric of
community within the technology domain.</p>
<p>Creating Communities for particular groups of individuals or specific
skill areas helps develop people and the organisation through improved
sharing of ideas and knowledge. It allows the organisation to experiment
and innovate from the ground up, supported by lightweight governance.</p>
<p>A typical way to build a Community is to encourage knowledge sharing
through appropriate tools and to bring together interested individuals
from across different Product Teams regularly. Ideas and improvements
to working methods or tools identified by these groups are likely to
contribute to the appropriate governance process, such as a Technical
Design Authority.</p>
<p>118 The Optimal Team</p>
<h2 id="key-points">Key Points</h2>
<ol>
<li>Team decisions and priorities should be

<p>120 Effective Leadership</p>
<p>At the heart of a strong Product Team is a leadership function
that can guide and direct the delivery of features that meet
user needs and add value to the organisation. The number
and type of individual roles may vary according to the scale of
the service provided and the structure of the delivery and
operations functions.</p>
<p>Leaders need a full 360-degree view of any initiative to manage
effectively, both outwardly to stakeholders and also within the
Delivery Team. They need to be capable of working with the
broader organisation on strategy and to enable good governance.
Effective leadership of empowered teams is where the most
leverage is gained for organisations looking to thrive in the
modern economy.</p>
<h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2>
<h3 id="project-service-management-leadership-convergence">Project &amp; Service Management Leadership Convergence</h3>
<p>Several innovations in technology are combining in a new model for
building and running the products and services that organisations
rely upon.</p>
<p>The rise of Cloud computing and the era of ‘software-defined everything’
means that software engineering practices are taking over the full
technology stack and heavily influencing not just the build, but also the
running of services - the DevOps model.</p>
<p>Effective Leadership 121</p>
<p>However, DevOps is not just about the technology of continuous delivery.
It is a cultural and organisational shift that requires a new way of
thinking about how to change and support products.</p>
<p>In addition to the expansion of software engineering practices into
technical operations, service management thinking is moving back up
the line into delivery. The lifecycle of a product does not begin when
software is delivered to Operations, but when an organisation conceives
and initiates the production of the idea.</p>
<p>Traditionally the ‘Build’ of a product was separate from the operations
required to ‘Run’ it. This led to two separate disciplines of project
management and service management. Increasingly, these areas overlap.</p>

<h3 id="three-key-leadership-components">Three Key Leadership Components</h3>
<p>A good Product Team requires three elements of leadership, often
provided by three or more individuals:</p>
<p>**1. Delivery (project and service) management</p>
<ol>
<li>Product domain expertise</li>
<li>Solution architecture.**</li>
</ol>
<p>Each has a role to play in working upward with the wider organisation
and stakeholders, and downward into the team delivering change and
running the service.</p>

<p>The common responsibilities of each of the key leadership roles are
explored in <strong>Table 5-1</strong>. Whilst the three leadership roles work together to
change and support the product, the responsibilities we outline do imply
some structure. Ultimately, as the plan and budget holder, the Delivery
Manager is accountable for the delivery of changes and the service for
the product.</p>

<p>This does not necessarily mean there is a strict reporting line from the
Solution Architect and the Product Manager into the Delivery Manager.
Sometimes, this relationship can be a complex dynamic; for example,
the Product Manager is provided by the organisation, and the Delivery
Manager and Solution Architect are from a third-party supplier.</p>
<p>124 Effective Leadership</p>
<p>The most important point is that all three areas must work together
to deliver a product focused on user needs that adds value to the
consumer as well as to the organisation.</p>
<h3 id="-necessary-and-sufficient-governance">‘Necessary and Sufficient’ Governance</h3>
<p>Governance often has a bad reputation amongst Delivery Teams. It
conjures up thoughts of bureaucracy, red tape, and reasons not to do
things. We have already established that the modern organisation needs
to change at a faster pace and continually evolve its products to meet
user needs. To do so, the role of governance must be to guide and
support with judicious management of risk.</p>
<p>Infrequent, onerous approval gates are replaced by lightweight, regular
guidance. This requires a mindset change for sponsors and executives.
Teams must be trusted to deliver and provided with regular support
to do their jobs. Executives have a responsibility to the organisation
to manage risk and ensure that people and resources are deployed
effectively. Discharging this responsibility requires engagement and
strong leadership.</p>
<p>Likewise, Delivery Teams are obliged to Executives to deliver on time and
within budget. They also must be consistently able to articulate progress
to Executives when required.</p>
<p>Teams have a part to play in building this trusted relationship through
demonstrating value-add to the organisation, and by being open and
transparent about challenges that exist. The judgement required here is
a key skill of the Leadership Team. Too often, change initiatives spiral out
of control due to a loss of confidence by stakeholders. This can become
a bigger problem than any underlying delivery issue. Teams need to
demonstrate they are in control whilst not hiding problems.</p>
<p>Effective Leadership 125</p>
<h3 id="defining-the-business-challenge">Defining the Business Challenge</h3>
<p>A well-defined business challenge is critical to project success.
Strategy should be the foundation of any Discovery phase – providing
the direction and boundaries for future decision making. When an
organisation is clear on the problem to solve and objectives to meet, an
investigation to surface internal and external insight can begin. It is this
insight, particularly that of the audience, that enables the selection of
promising ideas that reduce the risk of releasing unwanted products.</p>
<p>Tools like a Value Proposition Canvas ask teams to consider product
benefits, features, and experience through the lens of audience needs,
wants, and fears. The aim is to surface a differentiating idea that will
satisfy customers’ needs.</p>

<p>Developing a subsequent Business Value canvas can help to consolidate

attributes needed to support a successful business or service. This
approach asks you to consider:</p>
<p><strong>○ Who are the potential partners in your network, and what
resources or activities are available to you?</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ What activities and resources are needed to support the
value proposition?</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ What are the characteristics of your value proposition, and what
form will it take?</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Who is your audience, what factors differentiate them, and what
do they need from the experience?</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Which channels will you use to bring the product or
service to market, and how will you use them to reach your
audience segment?</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ How will you charge for the product/service and what costs do you
need to cover to remain viable?</strong></p>
<h3 id="estimating-work">Estimating Work</h3>
<p>One of our aims for this book is to help organisations build predictability
into their delivery process. The techniques we describe can help with
this, and a key point is to break change down into smaller pieces and
release often. Another essential factor is the process by which work is
estimated and sized, particularly when this is being undertaken to advise
funding for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).</p>
<p>Traditional project planning relies on decomposing the perceived work
and then estimating based on the effort (in person-days) required
to complete it. The drawback with such work breakdown structures
is that they require significant upfront Discovery work and assume</p>
<p>Effective Leadership 127</p>
<p>that functionality is relatively fixed. Both of these factors do not lend
themselves to Agility.</p>
<p>Alternative Agile methods of estimation take a more holistic approach,
sizing pieces of work based on relative size, risk, and complexity to
get an overall view of the effort required. A common method is to use
story points to mark the relative estimate of valuable items of work
(sometimes captured as user stories). Typically, the numbers used
are something like a Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34) to
demonstrate increasing uncertainty in larger, more complex stories.</p>
<p>The strength of story points as an abstract concept can also become
a significant weakness during Delivery. We have seen many projects
go awry due to the intangible nature of the metrics being used. For
small-scale change and the work of a small team, simple use of story
points and a velocity (the rate at which story points are currently
being delivered) may work. The drawbacks of story points on larger
programmes and MVP delivery can be significant and do not aid
predictability, notably:</p>
<p><strong>1. Many business sponsors do not understand the abstract concept</strong>
    <strong>of story points and want (need) to work in clear effort and</strong>
    **monetary terms</p>
<ol>
<li>Story points can lead to a lack of transparency over progress,<strong>
 </strong>particularly when they are diluted through re-estimation. Delivery<strong>
 </strong>of story points gives the illusion of progress even though the<strong>
 </strong>backlog is not reducing.**</li>
</ol>
<p>We would urge some caution when using story points, particularly in
conjunction with third party suppliers and contracts. Delivery of story
points does not always equate to progress towards the end goal and is
certainly not a measure of supplier productivity.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when used well, story points and relative estimation
can prove to be a far more reliable forecast for delivery than traditional
estimation and planning techniques.</p>
<p>128 Effective Leadership</p>
<h2 id="the-enterprise-agile-approach">The Enterprise Agile Approach</h2>
<h3 id="taking-a-risk-first-approach">Taking a Risk-First Approach</h3>
<p>We are strong advocates of active risk management and a risk-first
approach to delivery. Risk takes many forms. Some risks are under the
control of the Product Team, some they can influence, and others are
external to the organisation that they are unable to affect.</p>
<p>When considering implementing change to a product, it is essential to
take time to consider risk, its source, and what can be done to influence
or manage it. Taking a risk-first approach means tackling unknowns
early, providing the opportunity to fail fast, or adjust plans while there is
still time to do so.</p>
<p>In practical terms, the risk-first approach provides confidence in the
solution being delivered. This is affirmed through robust and ongoing
consultation with the audience(s), and the active participation of the
entire team in applying their skill and judgment to recognise potential
risks, and considering innovative approaches to address them. It is in
this area where the Delivery Manager and Analyst are expected to make
a significant contribution. We believe that managers should be actively
driving towards no surprises in delivering change, not simply reporting
on it. The manager is expected to fly ahead of the team to look for
potential obstacles.</p>
<p>Effective Leadership 129</p>
<p>The Enterprise Agile approach includes the following elements to help
realise the risk-first principle:</p>
<p><strong>The Product Lifecycle</strong></p>
<p>Use of Feasibility and Discovery phases ahead of Delivery to manage risk
to delivery, and ensure the solution meets audience needs.</p>
<p><strong>The Delivery Pipeline</strong></p>
<p>Fully automated software build and deployment using repeatable
processes rather than manual, error-prone alternatives.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Built-In</strong></p>
<p>Well thought through test approaches and important considerations
such as security, privacy, and accessibility to ensure a high-quality
product is delivered and assured.</p>
<p><strong>Architecture Centric</strong></p>
<p>Proving architecture early in the product lifecycle through the delivery
of valuable features, and ensuring that architecture evolves in a
controlled manner.</p>
<p><strong>Sprint Planning</strong></p>
<p>Making sure the high-risk areas of technical or functional delivery are
addressed in the early Sprints of the release.</p>
<p>130 Effective Leadership</p>
<h3 id="implementing-good-governance">Implementing Good Governance</h3>
<p>It has been our experience that clients expect something specific
delivered against a plan, for a particular date and a specified budget –
all agreed in advance. To achieve this over an extended period in an Agile
engagement requires appropriate governance.</p>
<p>Most clients have existing frameworks with which we must conform.
At first sight, these often appear to be heavyweight processes with
significant documentation overhead. However, they usually include
the essential gates designed to inform senior management decision
making and minimise corporate risk. It’s perfectly possible to make
an Agile delivery approach work in this type of environment, and a
‘Necessary and Sufficient’ documentation set can provide the level of
documentation and information required to support such decisions.</p>
<p>A good governance process should fulfil three key aims:</p>
<p><strong>○ Inform</strong> – Provide suitable performance indicators</p>
<p><strong>○ Escalate</strong> – Offer a route up in the organisation to raise
critical issues</p>
<p><strong>○ Assure</strong> – Keep the product aligned to organisation goals.</p>
<p>This process will involve regular meetings to discuss progress, status,
key risks, and issues. We believe that these should be focused and
aligned to the Sprint and Release cadence. This ensures they support
the delivery of Sprint plans, as well as report on the end of Sprint
deliverables and the achievement of Release commitments. This is
discussed in more depth in <strong>Chapter 7</strong> , where we consider the value of
Sprint backlogs, earned value, and a commitment to deliver.</p>
<p>We think that appropriate project governance is a vital element in the
success of all projects, especially Agile ones, and that it can be achieved
without a burdensome level of overhead.</p>
<p>Effective Leadership 131</p>
<h3 id="bridging-to-the-organisation">Bridging to the Organisation</h3>
<p>The key governance review meeting between the Product Team and
organisation executives is the Programme/Project Board or, perhaps
more appropriate in an Agile organisation, the Product Governance
Board. This provides the Product Team with the opportunity to request
additional support from the sponsor and to raise issues. The board
performs the function of steering product development to maintain
strategic alignment and levels of service received by the end-users.
Conflicting priorities may be escalated to this group for guidance.</p>

<h3 id="diligence-within-the-product-team">Diligence Within the Product Team</h3>
<p>Good governance is also important within the Product Team itself,
particularly as it grows. As far as possible, the Product Owner should
be trusted by the organisation to make decisions about the product
independently. That said, there are occasions where decisions that are
impacted by strategy, or that may impact the product within the wider
organisation or portfolio, may require some additional oversight and
ceremony. One area we believe that some ceremony is required is design
decision making. Using a Design Authority to record key design decisions
is a powerful tool to help plot and record the course the product takes
over time.</p>
<p>There are two facets to the Design Authority: functional design decisions
and technical design decisions. We recommend both are discussed at
the same forum. Taking decisions in isolation of a discussion about
delivery impact should be avoided. This group should be diverse and
include those managing the delivery of change, not just the service
design, technical, and analyst communities.</p>
<p>The frequency of the product design authority meetings may vary. The
more intense the phase of delivery and volume of change, the more
frequent the meetings are likely to be. This keeps change flowing and
minimises the number of decisions at any one time. Always bear in mind
that any delay resulting from a team waiting for an authority’s decision
will impede the team’s, as well as the wider organisation’s, ability to be
responsive and Agile.</p>
<p>Effective Leadership 133</p>
<p><strong>Figure 5-4: Product Design Authority</strong></p>
<p>The workings of the Design Authority are likely to be tied to the Sprint
delivery pattern. This ensures that areas of design related to work for the
following Sprint can be guided as necessary as requirements are further
elaborated. The Design Authority will operate within organisational
constraints, such as enterprise architecture.</p>

<h3 id="the-ongoing-importance-of-planning">The Ongoing Importance of Planning</h3>
<p>Agility does not mean foregoing a plan. Managing change requires
planning, but the real measure of success is demonstrable progress
towards the required outcomes. No team should slavishly follow a plan
without reference to defined goals. The level of planning depends on the
scale of the change and the level of Agility across the organisation.</p>
<p>Roadmaps typically exist at the organisation and product level. A
roadmap is a statement of intent, and suggests a phasing and rough
timing for initiatives. A plan is more detailed, but still subject to change.
The Sprint backlog describes a commitment by a team to deliver a
specific goal. Whilst there may still be some flexibility in how the goal is
delivered, the planned backlog items and tasks required to deliver them
should be understood.</p>
<p>Products that are relatively standalone and mature can evolve
through continuous product innovation and require little planning. The
replacement of a legacy system with a ‘big bang’ cutover and many
dependencies on third parties requires much more work. Planning is
usually most important during the inception of a product and getting to
MVP and launch.</p>
<p>We recommend that plans are layered with successive levels of
refinement. For the majority of small initiatives, a single-level Sprint plan
is often sufficient. For large-scale changes, there are commonly three
layers of planning that roll up into each other.</p>
<p><strong>High-Level Plan</strong></p>
<p>Planning at a high level will capture the major milestones and
interactions with other products and services across the organisation
and any external dependencies.</p>
<p>Effective Leadership 135</p>
<p>This high-level plan is generally outside the remit of the Product Team
and manages portfolio-level dependencies. This plan is key for
larger-scale change programmes and is often expressed as a flight
plan to bring together multiple, related workstreams and products.</p>
<p><strong>Mid-Level Plan</strong></p>
<p>The mid-tier of planning focuses on the work of the entire Product Team,
their interactions with each other and the bringing together of business
and technical change.</p>
<p>This artefact is the key guide for the Product Team and is owned by the
Delivery Manager with input from all the team leaders. It is this plan that
the governance process tracks against.</p>
<p><strong>Low-Level Plan</strong></p>
<p>A low-level plan looks at the day-to-day work of individual teams
delivering change and supporting the product. This layer is the most
fluid and often exists within the delivery pipeline tooling. This equates
to the individual Sprint Plan used to deliver change and release valuable
increments of the product.</p>
<p>136 Effective Leadership</p>
<h3 id="planning-across-lifecycle-phases">Planning Across Lifecycle Phases</h3>
<p>The role and level of planning evolves across the lifecycle.</p>
<p><strong>Feasibility</strong></p>
<p>At the Feasibility stage, the key activities are understanding the
objectives of the initiative. It is critical to define the value that the
initiative will provide for the customer (internal or external) as well as
the benefit the initiative will deliver for the organisation.</p>
<p>Feasibility can often be brief, perhaps even only a few days and involving
a handful of people. Planning activities at this stage involve ensuring
that key stakeholders are engaged, the candidate delivery options are
validated and understood, and a suitable proposal, including an initial
draft plan for delivery, is prepared.</p>
<p>Much of the effort in Feasibility should focus on building a robust plan
for Discovery that allows for that phase to conclude successfully.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery</strong></p>
<p>Several essential objectives must be achieved during Discovery - an
intensive phase designed to reduce risk and increase predictability
during delivery.</p>
<p>Where Discovery is more than a couple of weeks duration, a Discovery
phase plan should begin the operation of a Sprint pattern. This allows
for Agile principles of a regular heartbeat to facilitate course corrections
and demonstrable progress.</p>
<p>In contrast to many traditional initiatives, the Discovery phase may
result in the initiative being cancelled if it reveals that the customer</p>
<p>Effective Leadership 137</p>
<p>demand cannot be validated or the solution cannot be provided whilst
still delivering the benefits defined for the organisation in the
Feasibility stage.</p>
<p><strong>Delivery</strong></p>
<p>The Delivery plan is a Sprint-based plan that, whilst allowing for
refinement and change, is aimed at providing some degree of
predictability – particularly up to the point of MVP. An initial Sprint plan
for the MVP is built during Discovery.</p>
<p><strong>Generating a Sprint Plan</strong></p>
<p>It is useful to have a view of a few Sprints ahead to link Agile product
delivery with other fixed, real-world dependencies. One scenario where
a Sprint plan is most useful for a longer duration is in the delivery of a
Minimum Viable Product. This is generally because the initial product
delivery has some challenging real-world constraints and deadlines, and
the organisation is seeking more predictability.</p>
<p>Creating a Sprint plan requires that suitable structured analysis has
been undertaken to create a set of estimates against the required scope.
Developing the plan is then a matter of allocating work to Sprints based
on a set of priorities and the estimated capacity of the Delivery Team.</p>
<p>138 Effective Leadership</p>
<h3 id="estimating-for-mvp">Estimating for MVP</h3>
<p>The bulk of the effort to create an initial Sprint plan for the Minimum
Viable Product is identifying the features required and estimating the
work involved. The process of generating the scope for the Minimum
Viable Product and structuring requirements is covered in more detail in
<strong>Chapter 6</strong>.</p>
<p>If the research and analysis work has produced a backlog of epic
features (any large, complex, or risky piece of work that cannot be
delivered within a Sprint) to deliver, a good way to generate the
estimates for the plan is to take a top-down approach and ‘shirt size’
the requirements. The Discovery phase of the product lifecycle should
yield a functional scope against which to estimate. There are three
distinct stages of creating the estimate.</p>
<p><strong>Build the Model</strong></p>
<p>The build of the model is a case of listing out all of the feature epics
and applying a shirt size to them. We normally use five shirt sizes: XS,
S, M, L, XL. It is often useful at this stage to adopt a blind estimating
technique where members of the team do not compare results until the
exercise is completed, so as not to bias each other.</p>
<p>After this stage, we have identified the relative complexity of the epics
and flushed out any unknowns. It is also possible to see the potential
variance based on different estimators’ understanding of the problem.
The conversations that this process generates can be a useful way of
ensuring there is a common understanding of the requirements across
the team.</p>
<p>Effective Leadership 139</p>
<p><strong>Calibrate the Model</strong></p>
<p>It can then be useful to assign numbers to the model. To do this, we
will take a representative sample, perhaps up to 20% of the epics, and
decompose them into stories. These stories are then sized in ideal days.
It is essential at this stage to take a representative set of epics across
the product and of different shirt sizes.</p>
<p>From this stage of the process, we can determine the average effort
required for the delivery of each size and get an overall effort for
the MVP in ideal days. Factoring in an efficient ratio and capacity for
defects allows a total required capacity to be attained and a Sprint plan
to be built.</p>
<p><strong>Test the Model</strong></p>
<p>There is no substitute for doing actual work to determine the accuracy
of the estimation model. For a large product build, certain elements of
the solution will likely be prototyped during Discovery. These pieces of
work could be used to recalibrate the model.</p>
<p>Generally, we recommend that the same teams that conducted
Discovery should carry on into Delivery to ensure that the learnings are
not lost. If this is not possible, it will be necessary to adjust the ‘actuals’
from the Discovery phase if they are applied to the overall model.
Certainly, delivery metrics from the first few Sprints should be fed back.
It is also worth bearing in mind that the productivity of new teams,
whilst initially low, will increase during the early stages of delivery.</p>

<h3 id="managing-changes-to-the-plan">Managing Changes to the Plan</h3>
<p>The purpose of greater Agility in the organisation is to allow for flexibility
and responsiveness to adapt to evolving user needs. In this environment,
change is inevitable and should be encouraged.</p>
<p>There does, however, need to be some direction and stability as
provided by the roadmaps and plans created for individual products.
Whilst Product Teams should be empowered to do the things that users
need and release value for the organisation, change should not
be unconstrained.</p>
<p>Where a baseline scope has been created for a Product Increment
or Minimum Viable Product, it may, in exceptional circumstances, be
necessary to use Change Control to govern this. The use of a Change
Control process ensures that any revised scope remains true to the
organisation’s goals and that any outside dependencies can be adjusted.
It also allows for expectations to be managed if particularly large
features come in or out of scope, adjusting delivery dates or the need
for (interim) manual processes.</p>
<p>Minor changes as a result of regular story elaboration and items moving
between Sprints would not normally require Change Control. Major
scope changes at the epic level require visibility, and this may include
formal decision making.</p>
<h3 id="active-raid-management-for-improved-predictability">Active Raid Management for Improved Predictability</h3>
<p>Even if you can embrace continuous product innovation and exploit
Agile techniques across the organisation, you will still face changes
presented by the outside world. Active RAID (Risks, Assumptions, Issues,
and Dependencies) management is still as important as ever to avoid
unpleasant surprises.</p>
<p>Effective Leadership 141</p>
<p>We often find that these terms are misused, so it’s worth a quick recap
of the definitions.</p>
<p>Materialised risks, false assumptions, and missed dependencies
all result in issues. Teams also identify blockers through their daily

<h3 id="reporting">Reporting</h3>
<p>A key element of a Product Team leadership role is providing timely,
accurate reporting to enable fact-based decision making and
interventions. When too little or too much information is provided,
time-poor stakeholders cannot rapidly understand the current position,
and become frustrated. The Leadership Team must clearly articulate the
current position, supported by several relevant KPIs and metrics.</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-keyword">Definition</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">Example</span>

<p>Effective Leadership 143</p>
<p>Concerns arise when information is reported that does not represent
the complete picture. This can quickly become a distraction and result
in demands for further information. Before long, the Product Team is
spending a disproportionate amount of time servicing questions rather
than delivering. In the absence of the right information, stakeholders
make judgements based on perceptions. If this point is reached, it is
time to stop, take stock, and agree on a recovery plan to remedy the key
issues and return to fact-based conversations.</p>
<p>Metrics and data collection for reporting should be built into the delivery
tooling and, as far as possible, be automated. Minimal effort is required
from the team to record the tasks being worked on if the tools are set
up correctly from the outset.</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-keyword">Definition</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">Example</span>

</code></pre><p><strong>Table 5-3 continued: Suggested Reporting Contents</strong></p>
<p>144 Effective Leadership</p>
<p>It should be clear that delivery metrics are best used to understand
the rate of progress and product quality to aid planning and continuous
improvement, rather than a stick with which to beat team members.
Reporting should echo the message coming out of the Sprint
ceremonies, such as estimation and planning meetings and
Show and Tells.</p>
<p>A good report may include the key elements described in <strong>Table 5-3</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="keep-the-information-flowing">Keep the Information Flowing</h3>
<p>Whilst regular reporting is required to keep stakeholders informed, this
should not be the sole source of information. Delivery, service, and
quality metrics should always be visible to the team and stakeholders.</p>
<p>There should be no surprises for anyone in terms of the status of
delivery and progress towards agreed goals. The use of whiteboards and,
preferably, screens in the team environment is to be encouraged. It is
straightforward to get most modern tooling to display a dashboard to
highlight progress, quality, and service metrics.</p>
<p>The current delivery position should always be very visible to teams and
stakeholders. Everyone is signed up to working towards a set of common
goals, and progress towards these should be of interest to everyone.</p>

<p>148 Understanding Human-Centred Design</p>
<p>The last decade has seen a radical shift in the way
organisations solve problems and design products or services.
Human-centred design is a mindset and a method. It is a
practice of understanding human behaviours and identifying
insights that inform the design and delivery of better
user experiences.</p>
<p>A mature User Experience (UX) approach seeks to meet both
internal and external audiences’ expectations by deliberately
designing their experience to create the greatest value for both
the user and the organisation.</p>
<p>Human-centred design extends to planning and organising
internal teams, systems, infrastructure, and communication to
deepen the connection between the organisation and the user.</p>
<p>There are a multitude of terms and models used to describe all
elements of Human-centred design. While this can be confusing,
the most important point to remember is that the user need
should be paramount at the outset of strategic product
and service proposition development, and throughout the
delivery process.</p>
<h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2>
<h3 id="understanding-user-needs">Understanding User Needs</h3>
<p>Inaccurate assumptions, bias, departmental silos, and many other
challenges reinforce the importance of a Human-centred design
approach for successful delivery. When user needs are identified,</p>
<p>Understanding Human-Centred Design 149</p>
<p>they can set the shared strategic vision for all contributing teams
and stakeholders.</p>
<p>Empathy is one of the first steps in Human-centred design. Methods and
tools that help Agile Teams build empathy with users embed a better
understanding of user needs within the team and, subsequently, with
the wider stakeholder group. This first step generates the crucial insight
required to create solutions that are fit for purpose.</p>
<p>User research is a way to embed empathy within the team. The insight
generated reduces the risk of development, providing the team with the
confidence and understanding to build the right product or service at
pace. There are many different research techniques, from qualitative
in-depth observational field studies, guerrilla testing and face-to-face
interviews to quantitative analysis of user data.</p>
<p>Primary research, i.e., research that you conduct yourself, can
be supplemented with other sources. This is often referred to as
triangulation. Using more than one method to collect insight on the
same topic can assure the validity of research. For example, call centre
records or digital analytics provide good insight. Many online reports
and resources are also available, for example, Google Trends and Google
Correlate. ‘Review’ sources like app and retail stores can also be useful.</p>
<p>Empathising with users through research is often followed by ‘affinity
mapping’, which means grouping the insight into commonalities and
patterns which enable categorisation. Personas are an example of
research-based fictional characters that represent groups of users.
Personas provide a visual tool to help embed a common language and
user focus across a team. High-priority persona types and corresponding
user needs, often written as ‘stories’, will inform design, and strategic
and tactical prioritisation of ‘features’.</p>

<h3 id="evaluating-the-user-journey">Evaluating the User Journey</h3>
<p>Empathising with user groups is key to designing great experiences. A
user journey map is a visualisation of the process a user goes through to
accomplish a goal. It identifies tangible and emotional stages along the
process, as well as gaps and inefficiencies. It visually represents how
and why users make decisions. A journey map identifies user needs, pain
points, and journey barriers, as well as ‘loops’ or other nuances.</p>
<p>Understanding Human-Centred Design 151</p>
<p>Creating a journey map is a collaborative activity that aligns stakeholders
around a problem to be solved. Creating the user journey map is
essential to engage users of the product or service and proxy internal
stakeholders. Engage stakeholders from across the organisation, and
identify those likely to know where the opportunities to develop and
improve are.</p>
<p>Identifying the right altitude for the journey map will depend on the
problem to solve. Getting the altitude right is important. Too focused
and you will miss opportunities or fail to understand context, whilst
a high-level view may prevent you from identifying the gaps and
inefficiencies that require digital intervention and solution design.</p>
<h3 id="changing-human-behaviours">Changing Human Behaviours</h3>
<p>Designing an experience that motivates positive action determines
whether a solution is successful or not, and requires an understanding
of human behaviours. Principles from behavioural economics - ‘the
study of psychology into the analysis of the decision making’ are often
used in Human-centred design to encourage or deter behaviours. A
typical example is the habit-forming social network notification icon
which frequently persuades you to return.</p>
<p>This field of thinking underlines that human decision making is often
emotional and not rational (even when we fail to see it ourselves).
Recent digital technology has attracted attention to this knowledge
through ‘dark patterns’, stimulating counter-movements like ‘circular’
and ‘ethical’ design.</p>
<p><strong>Shaping a Human-Centred Organisation</strong></p>
<p>Once seen as a nice-to-have, Human-centred design has now proven
its commercial value – Wharton University concluded that the return
on investment of good user experience ranges from $2 to $100 for</p>
<p>152 Understanding Human-Centred Design</p>
<p>every $1 invested. This can be a powerful persuader for sceptical or
resistant stakeholders.</p>
<p>Organisations that become more human-centred advance through four
stages of maturity:</p>
<p><strong>1. No design</strong> - Design plays little to no role in the organisation; the
    user perspective is barely considered, and if it is, it relates to
    isolated initiatives
<strong>2. Design as styling</strong> - Design is only relevant in terms of form or
    aesthetic considerations. External suppliers usually drive any
    specific user experience considerations
<strong>3. Design as process</strong> - Design is a process in the development of
    products and services; the organisation implements specific and
    holistic processes to improve user experience
<strong>4. Design as strategy</strong> - Design drives innovation and the continual
    improvement process. The organisation views and acts on user
    insight strategically. Design is an integral component throughout
    the value chain.</p>
<p>The drive to create better experiences for all users - this includes
colleagues as well as consumers - should be a continuous goal for
everyone within an organisation. A human-centred mindset should not
be relegated to marketing or digital departments, or considered to be
visual improvements alone. The greatest benefit is realised when a
human-centred mindset is adopted throughout an organisation.</p>
<p>Understanding Human-Centred Design 153</p>
<h2 id="bjss-opinion">BJSS Opinion</h2>
<h3 id="embrace-a-human-centred-design-approach">Embrace a Human-Centred Design Approach</h3>
<p>Human-centred design is often synonymous with an interface or
interpreted as interaction, navigation, and interface design. This view
places the ownership of a ‘good user experience’ solely with a User
Experience Designer. Human-centred design is all-encompassing,
including the above and ranging through (but not limited to)
organisational strategy, systems integration, process modelling, content
design, accessibility, and performance. A complete understanding shows
that no single person is responsible for the user experience – instead,
it’s a collaborative team effort across all departments and partnerships.
This includes involving those who support the product in delivering
change – a key reason we advocate adopting a DevOps culture and
associated practices.</p>
<p>It is not sufficient to introduce Human-centred design towards the end
of a project, or expect visual enhancements to improve function. A more
organisationally-mature approach introduces exploratory and strategic
user research to validate, quantify, and set the direction of an initial idea
or purpose from the outset. This establishes a clear vision - enabling the
Product Owner and the Agile Team to make decisions confidently and
deliver a solution based on user insight.</p>

<p>Agile Teams should continue to involve users using tactical user
research to test and iterate products and services during Sprints.
The most effective processes build regular user testing into Sprint
planning - optimising the solution through development and into
live environments. Frequent testing and optimisation can encourage
stakeholders to embrace a release early and often approach generating
value more quickly.</p>
<p>Understanding Human-Centred Design 155</p>
<h3 id="generate-value-through-service-design">Generate Value Through Service Design</h3>
<p>Service design is the design of services from the perspective of their
users (both the consumers of the service and the deliverers of the
service). Service design can help develop an entirely new service or
improve an existing service.</p>
<p>A service helps people do something - like being treated for cancer,
buying a house, or doing your annual tax return. Service design looks
at the whole start-to-end process, including waits, channel changes,
escalations, and anything that can go wrong in delivering the service.
It also designs from front to back - from what users need to do, through
the supporting technology and processes, down to the underlying
infrastructure, integrations, and legal constraints required to make it
all work.</p>
<p>Successful services will create value for both the user and the
organisation. This is often achieved by identifying the opportunities
at the intersection of human desirability, technical feasibility, and
commercial viability.</p>

<p>When an organisation embraces service design, multidisciplinary teams
are created, bringing together Designers and other professionals, such as
marketing, sales, technical systems, product, and legal specialists.</p>
<p>157 Understanding Human-Centred Design</p>
<p>The multidisciplinary team collaborates to analyse, empathise, ideate,
and design each interaction between customers and the organisation.</p>
<p>We recommend including service design as a critical component of any
project involving users, and adhering to the following principles:</p>
<p><strong>○ Human-centred</strong> – The experience of all the people affected by the
service is considered</p>
<p><strong>○ Collaborative</strong> – Stakeholders from various backgrounds and
functions and representative users are actively engaged</p>
<p><strong>○ Sequential</strong> – The service is visualised and orchestrated as a
sequence of interrelated actions</p>
<p><strong>○ Iterative</strong> – An exploratory, adaptive, and experimental approach is
taken, iterating toward implementation</p>
<p><strong>○ Real</strong> – Needs are researched with users; ideas are prototyped and
tested with users</p>
<p><strong>○ Holistic</strong> – Services are designed to sustainably address the
needs of all stakeholders throughout the experience and across
the business.</p>
<p>In most cases, users want a quick and easy-to-use product or service
that is right first time. Organisations are likely to achieve this by taking
a holistic view to identify and improve gaps and inefficiencies in the
product or service. A service design blueprint is a key tool used to help
organisations achieve this goal.</p>
<h3 id="introduce-a-service-design-blueprint">Introduce a Service Design Blueprint</h3>
<p>A service blueprint is a visual operational tool that presents the
components of a service in enough detail for stakeholders to analyse,
implement, and improve it.</p>
<p>158 Understanding Human-Centred Design</p>
<p>Creating the blueprint is a valuable collaborative task that brings
together multidisciplinary stakeholders to share insight. The
multidisciplinary team produces the blueprint together. A service design
blueprint includes user actions, internal team actions, touchpoints,
processes, workarounds, and technology interactions. The line of
interaction through the middle divides the front stage (what consumers
see) and the backstage (what’s happening behind the scenes). A service
blueprint may also recognise other relevant in-progress programmes or
opportunities that have already been identified.</p>

<p>An ‘as is’ blueprint is usually created first to understand the existing
state of a service. This will identify the gaps and inefficiencies that
should be improved to create more value. It will also identify areas that
are performing well that can be celebrated and benchmarked. Creating a
‘future-state’ blueprint can then follow.</p>
<p>A service blueprint focuses stakeholders on the real problems to
solve. The blueprint will prompt and enable prioritisation activities
with key stakeholders, informing a shared roadmap to realise the
change required.</p>
<h3 id="set-strategy-with-evidence-based-design">Set Strategy with Evidence-Based Design</h3>
<p>Evidence-based design is the deliberate intention to base strategic
and tactical decisions on the best available research evidence to
improve outcomes for users. Within a rapidly changing environment,
user expectations and behaviours are evolving at pace, making
evidence-based design important for organisations to stay relevant
and reduce the cost and risk of change.</p>
<p>There can be a view within organisations that there is not enough time
or budget to gather evidence within the timeframes available. Yet, there
are many ways to achieve evidence-based design with minimal budget
and time. Guerrilla research, in particular, is a quick, low-cost way of
understanding user behaviours and experiences. It is usually done in
public spaces and does not require a rigorous recruitment process.
Evidence can also be achieved quickly by running user tests with just
five users. This provides valuable insight to inform the focused iteration
of a product or service. Further tests can then be helpful in subsequent
Agile Sprints.</p>
<p>It is essential through assurance and governance that insight gained
through research is shared with stakeholders to inform commercial
and technical strategy. Everyone within an organisation should be</p>
<p>160 Understanding Human-Centred Design</p>
<p>encouraged to understand the real needs and expectations of both
external and internal users. This will lead to a greater level of
human-centred organisational maturity.</p>
<p>Structuring the evidence clearly, for example, using visual tools such as
blueprints, journey maps, personas, and roadmaps, will support teams
across the organisation to collaborate towards a strategic vision by:</p>
<p><strong>○ Delivering a framework by which human, technical, and
commercial change can be aligned and implemented effectively</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Enabling the organisation to prioritise based on the features that
deliver the most value</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Allowing inter-dependencies between features to be identified,
informing allocation of work to Delivery Teams</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Providing a basis for estimating the size and scope of changes and
capacity planning in the Delivery Teams</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Allowing a link back to technical and functional architecture to
inform the risk associated with the change</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Providing traceability and a mechanism to track the progress
of the change through delivery within the context of the
problem domain</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Adding rigour to the analysis process making it more effective</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Providing assurance that the right questions have been asked and
the appropriate sources consulted</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Documenting in a lightweight manner the decisions that have been
taken and the route to arriving at a particular functional solution.</strong></p>
<p>Time and budget allocated to evidence the real user need will inform an
authentic focus on building the right thing, which will increase value for
users and the organisation, and the likelihood of innovation.</p>
<p>Understanding Human-Centred Design 161</p>
<h3 id="remove-barriers-to-human-centred-design">Remove Barriers to Human-Centred Design</h3>
<p>Human-centred design performs best when it is a shared mindset
across an entire organisation. This will often require a culture shift.</p>
<p>Embedding enterprise-wide Human-centred design concepts can be
challenging, and the process takes time. Traditionally, commercial and
business interests have taken a higher priority. This approach can lead to
costly mistakes that can be avoided by aligning human, commercial, and
technical requirements concurrently. Significant benefits and innovation
will be realised when these once siloed groups collaborate to identify
opportunities to create value.</p>
<p>While organisational culture is developing, there can be a conflict
between user needs and the technical feasibility and commercial
viability of addressing those needs. Taking the opportunity to
reframe any potential conflict into a positive drive for collaboration
and transparency around strategy and prioritisation is a step in the
right direction.</p>
<p>Focusing on outcomes is a great way to elevate the language and
conversation towards the value provided by Human-centred design -
‘who’ and ‘why’, and the velocity provided by Agile delivery - the ‘what’
and ‘how’.</p>
<p>Developing enterprise-wide Human-centred design maturity requires
focus on these integrated factors:</p>
<p><strong>○ Strategy</strong> - Strong leadership and commitment at executive level, a
healthy budget, roadmap planning, and resource prioritisation</p>
<p><strong>○ Culture</strong> - Active organisational-wide communication and
engagement about the benefits, building wide working knowledge,
cultivating UX careers and practitioners’ growth</p>
<p><strong>○ Process</strong> - Embedding the systematic use of UX research and design
methods into all areas of product development and service design</p>
<p>162 Understanding Human-Centred Design</p>
<p><strong>○ Outcomes</strong> - Intentionally defining and measuring the results
produced by user-centred design initiatives. Sharing insights and
successes widely across an organisation.</p>
<p>Many organisations promote themselves as ‘user first’ without having
a direct dialogue with users. It is essential to educate leaders and
decision-makers about the financial and cultural benefits that authentic
evidence-based Human-centred design brings.</p>
<h3 id="human-centred-design-evolution">Human-Centred Design Evolution</h3>
<p>Human-centred design continues to be an essential ingredient of
organisational strategy. With continuing advances in technology and
human behaviour, leaders and decision-makers have never been more
important to building a deep empathy for the people they want to
engage. It also helps organisations to become more innovative, flexible,
and faster in delivery.</p>
<p>The basic expectation an organisation must meet is a functional, usable,
reliable solution. Organisations that gain a deeper understanding of
users can then develop differentiators around emotion to attract and
retain engagement. Human-centred design can elevate an offering above
the competition.</p>
<p>Evolving examples of elements that require a Human-centred design
mindset and approach are AI, Voice and Virtual/Augmented Reality, all of
which are in their infancy and have huge potential to continue to disrupt
how organisations and society operates. Users will drive best practices
in conversational design, context-driven content, audio cues, and
virtual gesturing.</p>
<p>To remain relevant, leaders and decision-makers must tap into
the mindset of users to find the key to innovation. We encourage
organisations to create an ongoing dialogue with internal and external</p>
<p>Understanding Human-Centred Design 163</p>
<p>users, and experiment with technology to secure their relevance in
the future.</p>
<p>An important area of development in Human-centred design is
sustainability. It has long been recognised that design plays a crucial
role in ethics. It is now recognised that design also plays a key role in
supporting the world to harness a commitment to sustainability, helping
organisations to create behavioural change to improve the wellbeing of
all people and the environment.</p>
<p>The principles of Human-centred design correlate strongly with the
behavioural economics concept discussed earlier.</p>
<h2 id="the-enterprise-agile-approach">The Enterprise Agile Approach</h2>
<p>To compete in a constantly evolving environment, organisations need
to operate with focus, flexibility, and speed to bring high quality,
differentiated products and services to market. The risk of a laser focus
on velocity is that the overarching need to ‘get something delivered’
can lead to experiences that don’t meet real customer needs and fail to
deliver value. By integrating Human-centred design and Agile methods
within multidisciplinary teams, it is possible to release efficiently with
the confidence that the user will have a seamless experience with the
new or evolved product or service.</p>
<h3 id="-design-is-not-just-what-it-looks-and-feels">‘Design is not just what it looks and feels</h3>

<p>164 Understanding Human-Centred Design</p>
<h3 id="the-who-why-of-delivery">The Who &amp; Why of Delivery</h3>
<p>Enterprise Agile focuses on the ‘what’ and the ‘how’ of delivery, and
aims to increase delivery velocity by breaking up the planning and
scope into smaller units. Human-centred design looks at the ‘who’
and the ‘why’ of a problem. New ideas are generated through a series
of user-focused exercises that culminate in identifying a solution.
Human-centred design aims to create value for the user and the
organisation by focusing on users’ needs and asking questions about
the specific problem to solve.</p>
<p>Enterprise Agile and Human-centred design are complementary
mindsets and methods that ensure user stories have strong acceptance
criteria. The ‘so that’ (the ‘why’) part of the story is as well understood
by Agile Teams as the ‘how’.</p>
<p>Successful Agile Teams will include Human-centred design disciplines.
Human-centred Designers (including user experience, user interface,
content design) will challenge the team to identify what they know
rather than what they think they know. Questions might include:</p>
<p><strong>○ Did you begin Discovery by interacting with your users and
understanding their problem?</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ If yes, how many users did you interview? Is this number enough,
or should you speak with more users?</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Is your problem well defined into an actionable
problem statement?</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Is it possible to further break down your problem into
sub-problems?</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ When was the last time you revisited your problem statement?</strong></p>
<p>This attention to detail can mean backlog refinement takes longer, but
the benefits include better stories, greater user understanding, and more
value delivered faster. Human-centred design can be challenging to</p>
<p>Understanding Human-Centred Design 165</p>
<p>integrate seamlessly into established delivery cultures, but the benefits
shouldn’t be underestimated. Human-centred design will influence
epics, features, and stories. It will inform prioritisation and feedback at a
strategic and tactical level.</p>
<h3 id="the-right-problem-to-solve">The Right Problem to Solve</h3>
<p>Human-centred design is a mindset and method relevant during all
phases of the Agile delivery cycle, including Feasibility, Discovery, and
Delivery. It promotes a continual focus on:</p>
<p><strong>○ Understanding the problem from the users’ point of view</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Designing the right solution, with significant influence from
technical feasibility</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Ensuring the solution is commercially viable and sustainable.</strong></p>
<p>Traditionally, there has been a focus on implementing a solution that
meets technical or organisational requirements instead of the user
need. This can result in products and services with unusable or ignored
features that frustrate users.</p>
<p>Human-centred design uses divergent and convergent techniques to
understand a problem from the users’ perspective, design a solution,
and deliver that solution to the market. The double diamond model
has been used to guide this process since the British Design Council
popularised it in 2005. There are now many models that support teams
with the Human-centred design method and mindset.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 6-5: Double Diamond, adapted from the Design Council</strong></p>
<p>An iteration of the Design Council’s double diamond model in 2021
recognises that the process is circular and that regular connection and
communication outside the Agile Team are essential to maintaining
success. It also recognises the importance of sustainability.</p>
<p>The first diamond focuses on exploring and framing the problem space,
identifying the right problem to solve through divergent and convergent
thinking. The second diamond is focused on creating and delivering
the right solution in the right way. While real user problems are being
identified and solutions developed during the process, the steps may
jump forwards and backwards. Reverting is often a result of further user
insight uncovered, making refinement or skipping forward necessary due
to relevant insight being already available and interpreted.</p>
<p>Understanding Human-Centred Design 167</p>
<h3 id="human-centred-design-artefacts">Human-Centred Design Artefacts</h3>
<p>Artefacts should be transparent, accessible by all teams and evolve
as new insight is identified. The Agile Manifesto states a preference
for working software over comprehensive documentation. The
Human-centred design mindset leans towards a preference for visual
documentation. Four Agile principles aid in producing only artefacts that
record or disseminate information:</p>
<p>**1. Document what the user needs</p>
<ol>
<li>Produce the artefacts that support teams during the delivery<strong>
 </strong>of the change</li>
<li>Document what work was done to support the change</li>
<li>Create perpetual ‘working’ versions that evolve with change.**</li>
</ol>
<p>Human-centred design and Agile are collaborative methods. The Agile
Team and stakeholders will use the visual artefacts and tools produced
during research and collaborative workshops to set the vision, identify
problems, and prioritise and test solutions. There are many artefacts
and tools that can be produced. Here are a few of our favourites:</p>
<p><strong>Personas/Archetypes</strong></p>
<p>Personas and archetypes are research-based fictional characters
representing user groups and act as visual tools for easier
comprehension. High-priority persona types and corresponding user
needs, often written as a narrative, will inform design and can be used
to support strategic and tactical prioritisation.</p>
<p>168 Understanding Human-Centred Design</p>
<p><strong>Journey Mapping and Service Blueprinting
(Current State)</strong></p>
<p>‘As is’ or current state user journey maps and service blueprints visualise
the users’ physical and emotional interaction with an organisation across
touchpoints. Identifying the current state enables the clear identification
of gaps and inefficiencies in the current offering. Further information on
journey mapping and service blueprinting is provided above.</p>
<p><strong>Wireframe</strong></p>
<p>A wireframe is a static, low-fidelity visual representation of different
layouts that form a product. Wireframes are used to communicate
structure, content, and functionality, helping Delivery Design Teams
create a shared understanding of a future vision. Wireframes are often
used as a precursor to prototypes.</p>
<p><strong>Prototype</strong></p>
<p>There are many kinds of prototypes to suit all timeframes and budgets.
There are low-fidelity paper prototypes which are typically hand-drawn
sketches of the intended solution.</p>
<p>Mid-fidelity prototypes are visually complete representations of
solutions but usually not functional. High-fidelity prototypes are visually
complete and interactive models which users can explore.</p>
<h3 id="integrating-human-centred-design">Integrating Human-Centred Design</h3>
<p>Both Human-centred design and Agile are fluid methods providing
guidance rather than instruction. It is important to remember that ‘one
size does not fit all’ in terms of organisational transformation, user
need, or products and services to deliver. With this in mind, it is helpful</p>
<p>Understanding Human-Centred Design 169</p>
<p>to take a Lean approach, and use the best elements of both methods
to deliver the right solution properly within the specific landscape. In
general, we recommend that organisations or departments integrate
Human-centred design within Enterprise Agile. This can be achieved by
following this process:</p>
<p><strong>○ Engagement</strong> - Start small, integrating one or two teams. Focus
on the quick wins, the high-value, low-risk opportunities to gain
experience using Human-centred design and Agile together. As the
capability matures, expand to more challenging initiatives</p>
<p><strong>○ Adoption</strong> - Create more cross-functional/multidisciplinary teams
to design and develop solutions. The teams should promote
frequent collaboration across disciplines and frequent collaboration
with users</p>
<p><strong>○ Sustainability</strong> - Collaboration and co-creation are essential to
achieve successful and sustainable integration. Teams in supporting
functions, such as legal and finance, will also need to adapt to
new collaborative ways of working. If an established Technical
Development Team integrates with Human-centred design,
provide training in the value of empathy, definition, and ideation to
achieve the right balance of design and development. Embed the
understanding that Human-centred design is relevant during all
phases of the delivery cycle</p>
<p><strong>○ Success</strong> - Full integration will result in a clear understanding
across all Agile Teams of the ‘who’ and the ‘why’ of what they are
delivering as well as the ‘what’ and the ‘how’.</p>
<p>Just like Agile, Human-centred design is a continuous effort. The
mindset to promote is to continually gather user insight to identify
changing requirements and evolve products incrementally. Users and
their insight are integral to the product and service development
process, and critical to the successful convergence of Human-centred
design and Agile methodologies.</p>
<p>170 Understanding Human-Centred Design</p>
<h2 id="key-points">Key Points</h2>
<ol>
<li>Human-centred design is a mindset and
 a method. When it is disconnected from
 product design and engineering, or
 applied retrospectively, its impact is
 severely compromised.</li>
<li>Human-centred design without the user
 is a surprisingly common mistake. If you
 genuinely want to understand the problem,
 there is no avoiding talking directly to users.</li>
<li>Well-structured visual information beats
 duplicated and daunting volumes of data.
 Human-centred design artefacts that are
 minimal, memorable, and shareable will
 significantly impact teams and stakeholders.</li>
<li>Too often, organisations fail to apply what
 they learn. Don’t disregard user insight due
 to uninvestigated technical barriers, resource
 constraints, or personal opinion. The users
 should set the vision; without this approach,
 the final result will be compromised.</li>
<li>Design experiences that are grounded
 in psychology and with regular testing.
 Prototypes have the added benefit of helping
 stakeholders to imagine the end goal.</li>

<h1 id="crafting-the">Crafting the</h1>
<h1 id="product-increment">Product Increment</h1>
<p>172 Crafting the Product Increment</p>
<p>New increments of functionality are periodically released to users
by the Product Team. This increment may consist of technological
enhancements or new features. Irrespective of delivery method,
the new features help evolve the product in ways that improve
the experience for the user, address an unmet need, and add
value for the customer and to the organisation.</p>
<p>Historically, releasing increments of change carried significant
overhead. This typically builds up in an organisation over time.
Change carries a perceived or actual risk, and processes are
introduced to counter this. This ‘release tax’ means releases
occur less frequently, become bigger and are inherently riskier.
As a result, the problem is perpetuated. Continuous Delivery and
DevOps techniques help organisations break free from this trap.</p>
<h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2>
<h3 id="the-product-increment">The Product Increment</h3>
<p>The unit of change is the Product Increment. This is the delta that gets
released to users following implementation by the Product Team. A
Product Increment may be small and consist of a single simple change
or be much larger and contain many changes.</p>
<p>When making a change to a product, it is important to consider the
full stack of elements required and to release this as a cohesive unit.
Implementing the change should involve releasing the technology and
supporting processes simultaneously.</p>

change to the product is inclusive of all components required to provide
value for users and the organisation.</p>
<p>This full stack of change incorporates data, technology (application
and infrastructure), Service Wrap, and organisation change. This can
be a challenge when the Agile technology delivery meets the non-Agile
world of people change, recruitment, training, etc. This is where the real
breakthrough in organisational Agility can occur.</p>
<p>174 Crafting the Product Increment</p>
<p>Success here is easier to obtain for digital products and systems of
engagement than for systems of record. Well-structured analysis around
user needs and a compelling user experience will minimise the need
for areas such as user training. The layers of the full stack are explored
further below.</p>
<p><strong>Organisation Change Layer</strong></p>
<p>Deals with the business impact created through updates to the
technology components of the product and/or changes to manual,
non-technology-driven product features such as fulfilment and logistics.</p>
<p>Where a new user feature is realised in both technology and
organisational change, these activities should be aligned in the
Product Increment.</p>
<p><strong>Service Wrap Layer</strong></p>
<p>Defines the supporting people, processes, and technology to ‘run’
the technology product in line with user expectations and agreed
service levels.</p>
<p>Changes to the underlying technology infrastructure and application
should result in corresponding and fully aligned changes to the
supporting processes.</p>
<p><strong>Application Layer</strong></p>
<p>The software required to realise the features of the product that
are delivered through technology. Changes here are taken from the
prioritised backlog of features identified through structured analysis.</p>
<p>Crafting the Product Increment 175</p>
<p><strong>Infrastructure Layer</strong></p>
<p>The underlying platform on which the application software resides.
Rapid Agile change is easier to obtain here when using software-defined
infrastructure in some form of Cloud solution.</p>
<p>The underlying configuration management database (CMDB) should
evolve incrementally in sync with the application software.</p>
<p><strong>Data Layer</strong></p>
<p>Data is a frequently overlooked component of change. This must be
considered. Changes to the data model, reference, data, test data, and
production data must be factored into the change.</p>
<p>Failure to test a change with production data is a common cause of
difficulties in getting a technology change to function properly.</p>
<h3 id="alternative-modes-of-operation">Alternative Modes of Operation</h3>
<p>There are two common ways of delivering a Product Increment. Firstly,
each change can be considered in isolation and released as required.
Secondly, several Features, perhaps related under a theme, can be
delivered together using a Sprint pattern.</p>
<p>The mode used typically depends on the volume of change, size of the
team, or, more significantly, the maturity of the product. Where Feature
change is low in a mature product and changes are typically defect
related, these are more likely to be fixed and released without a
Sprint pattern.</p>
<p>176 Crafting the Product Increment</p>
<p>During the development of a Minimum Viable Product, or making
significant or several feature changes, a Sprint pattern is more useful.</p>
<p>For the bulk of the work we do, we find a Sprint pattern and the
associated events very useful and, in the case of any significant new
product development, essential.</p>

<h3 id="always-use-the-process">Always Use the Process</h3>
<p>A key part of the power of Agile is the feedback loop - an ability to fail
fast, learn, and make many minor course corrections rather than storing
up and having to deal with a big problem. The Sprint events we describe
in this chapter embody this thinking. The use of the Sprint enables the
adoption of Lean thinking and a learning loop as illustrated in <strong>Figure 7-2</strong>.</p>
<p>To get the benefit of the activities required to plan, monitor, and control
a Sprint, they must be undertaken systematically. All too often when we
are engaged in project or programme recovery, we see that these basics
have slipped in some way, such as:</p>
<p><strong>○ Retrospectives are cancelled because the team is too busy</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Incorrect participation in planning sessions</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Show and Tell meetings moved out</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Sprints extended.</strong></p>

<h3 id="starting-and-finishing-a-story">Starting and Finishing a Story</h3>
<p>We want to be confident that, in developing a Product Increment, it is
complete on delivery and meets quality expectations. To achieve this
and run a productive delivery pipeline relies upon understanding what
‘good’ looks like, both before and after implementing the change.</p>
<p>Commonly used techniques for achieving this include the use of a
<strong>Definition of Ready</strong> and a <strong>Definition of Done</strong>. These terms should
be defined and communicated in such a way that the whole team
recognises them and can call out any deviations they observe.</p>
<p>Failure to be strong around the implementation of these criteria can
easily result in the wrong change being delivered or delivered to a poor
level of quality. Never, ever, no matter how tempting, fudge the Definition
of Done. Change is not done until it is done! Significant issues will result
from watering down the Definition of Done. Transparency over delivery
progress will be lost and, in our experience, the team rarely catches up.</p>
<p>Using a Definition of Ready ensures that requirements, usually expressed
as user stories, are completed to a high standard and provide a strong
basis for estimating and tracking against. Teams often use the acronym
<strong>INVEST</strong> to provide an effective and easy to remember Definition of
Ready. This definition may be modified where required, provided that all
the team sign up to it.</p>

<p>Similarly, a Definition of Done is produced in agreement with the team
and clearly communicated. Implementing a good Definition of Done can
be problematic. This should be an auditable checklist that is sufficiently
exhaustive to safeguard delivery and quality without being too unwieldy.</p>
<p>‘Done’ is often an emotive point. Ultimately, a change is not done until it
is in the hands of users. This is where some teams find it useful to have
multiple layers of Definition of Done that map to the relevant endpoints
for particular activities. It is essential to be clear on expectations around
the Definition of Done with stakeholders. Nobody likes an unpleasant
surprise and to be told something is finished when it isn’t.</p>
<p>We find it useful to link the Definition of Done back to the V-model. To
avoid complexity and ensure proper Agility, we believe that there can
be no more than three levels of Definition of Done. This is mapped to a
simplified V-model in <strong>Figure 7-3</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="sprint-delivery-patterns">Sprint Delivery Patterns</h3>
<p>The use of Sprints sets the delivery cadence, with Sprint events taking
place at the start, during, and at the end of a Sprint. We are often
asked about the optimum Sprint length. The team needs time to deliver
stories that are meaningful to the user, but Sprints cannot be too
long otherwise the benefits of the process are lost. In our experience,
anything longer than four weeks is too long, and anything less than a
week is too short. Our default position is for two-week Sprints.</p>
<p>The objective of any Sprint is to complete the planned user stories
consistent with the Definition of Done. For small-scale changes, this will
often mean that the solution is ready to go into production.</p>
<p>Our experience has shown that, for larger initiatives and in larger
organisations, it is often not practical to achieve this in the short term.
As a result, for larger-scale change initiatives, there are likely to be
further activities to be concluded to wrap up the release and get it into
production. In these cases, it should be the ambition of the team to
‘extend’ their Definition of Done to include more of the activities that
enable a Product Increment to be released.</p>
<p>As far as possible, the activities to make the stories delivered in a
Sprint ready for live should be undertaken in the Sprint to avoid a
Waterfall-style endgame. A release will only take place when there is
a meaningful Product Increment that adds value, and this may take
more than one Sprint to achieve. It can take many Sprints to get to the
point of an initial Minimum Viable Product release. In this situation, we
recommend that the path to live is still automated and rehearsed to
avoid back-loaded risk.</p>

delivery pattern in which a Product Increment is released every three
Sprints. This pattern identifies the use of two special-purpose Sprints</p>
<ul>
<li>Sprint 0 and the Release Sprint are used to achieve particular aims
aside from Feature delivery. Where a release does not occur every Sprint,
it may be necessary for a Release Sprint to be used to bring together
non-Agile workstreams and activities, such as organisation change, and
less Agile technology delivery of back-office systems in a multi-modal
technology landscape.</li>
</ul>
<p>Crafting the Product Increment 185</p>
<h3 id="use-of-special-sprints">Use of Special Sprints</h3>
<p><strong>Sprint 0</strong></p>
<p>The first Sprint of technology delivery is a special purpose Sprint to
prepare the ground for effective delivery in subsequent Sprints. In
essence, Sprint 0 bootstraps and primes the delivery pipeline. On
large-scale change initiatives, earlier phases of risk reduction, such
as Discovery, may have already built the delivery pipeline to produce
architectural PoCs. In this case, Sprint 0 will focus on making the
delivery pipeline production quality and able to scale for use by the
full team.</p>
<p>It is useful to build a set of technical stories with acceptance criteria
to define the activities of Sprint 0, just as you would for any other
feature Sprint. Whilst the specific technical tasks of a Sprint 0 will vary
by product and technology stack, we have identified some key goals
of a Sprint 0 below. In each case, as with any user story, it is worth
identifying and recording the customer value that each technical story
will bring, be it security, performance, quality, or anything else relevant
to the product in question.</p>

<p><strong>Release Sprints</strong></p>
<p>A Release Sprint is a special vehicle for wrapping up change and
getting it into the hands of users. The aim should always be to deliver
production-ready software after each Sprint. There are some occasions
where additional activities are required, such as final compliance steps
like mobile app store verification, integration with non-Agile work
streams, or alignment with certain organisational change activities.</p>
<p>In these situations, such work can be done in parallel to feature Sprints.
Or, where the effort required may be considerable, the team can be
given time away from feature delivery to focus on release activity. The
use of Release Sprints cannot be mandated by any particular rules; it is
a useful tool to consider when delivering complex products and change
across the organisation.</p>
<h3 id="the-practices-of-effective-sprints">The Practices of Effective Sprints</h3>
<p>Day one and day ten of a Sprint will not necessarily be the same. There
is a pattern to a Sprint that is required to ensure successful high-quality
delivery of change. Specific activities are required to plan, execute,
control, and wrap up a Sprint.</p>
<p>A small number of key activities make a Sprint successful. In our view,
all are essential to ensure productive, high-quality delivery, manage
expectations, and avoid surprises.</p>

<p><strong>Planning</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of the Sprint planning session is to agree on the work that
will be delivered by the team in the upcoming Sprint. This is usually
achieved by taking a set of stories that meet the Definition of Ready into
the next Sprint. These meetings usually include the whole Delivery Team
and the Product Owner. The team works through the prioritised product
backlog and receives any clarifications on user needs from the Product
Owner and Analysts.</p>
<p>A key part of the planning process is estimating the stories taken into
the Sprint and decomposing them into the relevant tasks. In <strong>Chapter
5</strong> , we discussed the estimation process used during Discovery. At that
stage, blind estimation techniques can be useful, however, at Sprint
planning, we recommend consensus-based estimation. Teams may use
a form of Agile planning poker to arrive at estimates. Using this method,
the story is discussed, and each member of the team offers their
estimate. Sometimes, this is done by showing a card from a set with the
Fibonacci sequence numbers on them.</p>
<p>The advantage of this estimation technique is that it flushes out
unknowns and information that not all team members might have. Not
only does it support knowledge transfer across the team, but it is also
likely to result in better estimates.</p>
<p>For this session to be effective, some work will have to be done in
advance by Analysts with the team to ensure that the candidate stories
are suitably elaborated to be developed and meet the Definition of
Ready. In addition, Analysts and Team Leads will be working ahead by
one or two Sprints to manage any dependencies with the leadership
functions to ensure the story is independent of others.</p>
<p>Working ahead of the Sprint planning process may also throw up some
design work and decisions. Where necessary, these should be taken to
the design authority before Sprint planning. When filling a Sprint with</p>
<p>Crafting the Product Increment 189</p>
<p>stories, in some cases it may be prudent to include capacity for defects
and support incidents.</p>
<p>The output of the Sprint planning meeting should include:</p>
<p><strong>1. The Goal of the Sprint</strong> - The goal defines why the Sprint is valuable
    to customers or stakeholders with an interest in the product
<strong>2. The Sprint Backlog</strong> - The set of estimated prioritised stories for
    delivery in the Sprint, as well as a plan for delivering them as part
    of the next product increment
<strong>3. Quantifiable Spare Capacity (when required)</strong> - To handle defects
    and support incidents coming through that need to be addressed
    by the Sprint
<strong>4. A Commitment to Deliver</strong> - All parties involved offer their
    support for the delivery of the Sprint backlog; this includes
    external dependencies that may need to be secured by the
    Leadership Team.</p>
<p><strong>Daily Stand-up</strong></p>
<p>The daily Stand-up is the heartbeat of the Product Team. We believe it
applies equally well to Delivery and Service Teams. Each team will run
its own Stand-up. In a Product Team of multiple teams, each Team Lead
will get together and run a Team Lead Stand-up.</p>
<p>The objectives of the daily Stand-up are to ensure that:</p>
<p><strong>1. Progress to the Sprint goal is reviewed and the Sprint backlog is</strong>
    **adjusted as necessary</p>
<ol>
<li>Any blockers are identified and quickly addressed or escalated</li>
<li>A plan for the next day of work is agreed upon by the team.**</li>
</ol>
<p>To meet these simple objectives, the format is kept clear and focused.</p>
<p>190 Crafting the Product Increment</p>
<p>The team can use any structure or techniques they want to conduct the
daily Stand-up so long as they emphasise the team’s progress towards
the Sprint goal. This encourages focus and supports self-management.</p>
<p>It is the job of the Team Lead to control the Stand-up and make sure
that any debate is taken away and continued outside the meeting.
Typically, the Stand-up will not take any longer than 10 minutes, and is
usually best conducted first thing in the morning when the team arrive –
after they have made a cup of coffee. They are called Stand-ups for
a reason - these sessions should never be conducted seated in a
meeting room!</p>
<p><strong>Show and Tell</strong></p>
<p>The Show and Tell is the end-of-Sprint ceremony for wrapping up the
delivery with the key stakeholders. During Sprint planning at the start
of the Sprint, all parties will have agreed to what stories are going to
be delivered. The Show and Tell demonstrates those stories as either
working software or other change artefacts.</p>
<p>We believe in establishing clear traceability, so the demonstration
of work delivered is usually accompanied by a brief presentation or
dashboard showing what was committed to during Sprint planning,
and what has now been delivered along with a summary of any known
issues. A simple example of this is illustrated in <strong>Figure 7-6</strong>.</p>
<p>Crafting the Product Increment 191</p>
<p><strong>Figure 7-6: Simple Traceability Report for Show and Tell</strong></p>
<p>Show and Tell meetings are usually held at the end of the Sprint. The
team should be ready to hold this session by the end of the Sprint.</p>
<p>This meeting is also an opportunity for the Product Owner to review the
product backlog and adjust it in the light of changes in the environment
or in response to new information. The Show and Tell is a working
session and the team should avoid limiting it to a presentation.</p>

<p><strong>Retrospective</strong></p>
<p>The Retrospective meeting is another Agile feedback loop and is an
essential part of the process. It is held within the Product Team and is
used to mature the process and iron out wrinkles. The retrospective
allows the team to identify what went well and what they would like to
change. It also allows persistent issues and challenges to be escalated.</p>
<p>The format of the retrospective is straightforward:</p>
<p><strong>1. The team assembles and the Lead sets the context and reminds</strong>
    **the team of the format</p>
<ol>
<li>Everyone records the things they think should or should not<strong>
 </strong>continue, either on physical notes or in electronic format</li>
<li>The observations are grouped into related themes</li>
<li>The team agrees which theme is most likely to help them increase<strong>
 </strong>their effectiveness</li>
<li>The team agrees on at least one action that it will implement<strong>
 </strong>as soon as possible (ideally in the next Sprint) to improve its<strong>
 </strong>effectiveness. Frequently, these actions are added to the Sprint<strong>
 </strong>backlog for the forthcoming Sprint, which is important for creating<strong>
 </strong>actionable continuous improvement.**</li>

<p>There are many ways of categorising the feedback, however, we prefer to

<p>194 Crafting the Product Increment</p>
<h3 id="updating-the-service-wrap">Updating the Service Wrap</h3>
<p>As highlighted at the beginning of this chapter, the broader Product
Team working together to deliver a complete Product Increment is
essential to achieving organisation Agility. The change released is not
just a technology update, but also a corresponding update to the
supporting processes.</p>
<p>In <strong>Chapter 9</strong> , we explore how the delivery pipeline can now automate
many of the traditional service functions. That said, it is still necessary
to ensure that Support Teams are familiar with the new functionality
and can effectively handle incidents raised by users. This work should
be quite lightweight. We expect Support Teams to be working alongside
Delivery Teams as part of the broader Product Team.</p>
<p>Service Teams will have full visibility of change flowing through the
delivery pipeline and be included in broader team activities and Sprint
ceremonies. The key here is not to treat service as distinct from change,
but to include Service Teams in the wider Product Team.</p>
<h3 id="combining-organisation-and-technology-change">Combining Organisation and Technology Change</h3>
<p>The Sprint pattern is not just applicable to delivering technology change,
it is also suitable for delivering the full Product Increment. Often, some
non-technological change carries real-world constraints, particularly
those around operational logistics and personnel that require legal and
contractual input - alignment is required.</p>

<pre><code>S<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span> Backlog
</code></pre><p>Aligning organisation and technical change starts with a clear strategy
and objectives. This is essential and feeds the structured analysis work
that provides the links between technology and manual processes.
The User Journeys produced to describe the required changes will
identify what is achieved using technology (‘in-system’) and what is
delivered via manual processes (‘out-of-system’). The Agile nature of
the delivery means that scope will change, and decisions based on
the value derived by the organisation will refine the in-system versus
out-of-system boundary.</p>
<p>196 Crafting the Product Increment</p>
<p>We recommend that the organisation change activities required to
support new product features be delivered as part of the same Sprint
pattern to minimise a potentially risky rollout of the change. The
definition of manual processes and supporting artefacts should be
produced at the same time as the related technological change and is
often undertaken by a specialist team of Analysts.</p>
<h2 id="key-points">Key Points</h2>
<ol>
<li>Make sure a deliverable Product Increment
 includes the changes to all aspects of the
 product stack - business change, Service
 Wrap, and technology (application, data,
 and infrastructure).</li>
<li>Only take stories into Sprint that meet the
 Definition of Ready and only earn value from
 stories that meet the Definition of Done.</li>
<li>Use a Sprint 0 at the start of the Delivery
 phase to initiate the delivery pipeline and
 get all the necessary tooling and automation
 in place.</li>
<li>Ensure every Sprint includes sessions for
 planning and estimating, daily Stand-ups,
 Show and Tells, and Retrospectives, and that
 these are never cancelled.</li>
<li>Align organisation change and manual
 process updates to the same Sprint delivery
 and release cadence.</li>

<p>198 Engineering Quality Outcomes</p>
<p>Technology delivery is a fascinating discipline that combines
engineering precision with a creative flair. We believe that the
best quality outcomes in terms of technology delivery arise from
a structured approach to engineering built around automated,
repeatable processes that are flexible enough to evolve as
business goals grow or change.</p>
<p>The field of software engineering is constantly evolving and
innovations such as software-defined infrastructure have brought
new opportunities and challenges for delivering Agile change. We
have long advocated the need to remove back-loaded risk from
technology delivery through continuous integration, automated
test and deployment.</p>

<h3 id="key-components-of-engineering-delivery">Key Components of Engineering Delivery</h3>
<p>The modern engineering landscape as popularised by the term DevOps
comprises the three key components illustrated in <strong>Figure 8-1.</strong></p>
<p>200 Engineering Quality Outcomes</p>
<p>It is important to note that the key enabler to DevOps is good quality
assurance through test automation (which itself needs a sound test
architecture behind it to ensure appropriate coverage and relevance).
Many organisations recognise the need to bring Development and
Operations together as a way of releasing change to users often and
delivering the benefits of Agility across the organisation. Effective QA is
the means of managing that risk and making DevOps a reality.</p>
<h2 id="bjss-opinion">BJSS Opinion</h2>
<h3 id="start-with-strong-architecture">Start With Strong Architecture</h3>
<p>Good engineering starts with strong architecture. For a time during the
early days of Agile delivery, the term ‘emergent architecture’ became
fashionable. Coding without architecture isn’t Agile delivery, it’s hacking</p>
<ul>
<li>nothing more than a code and fix approach. Whilst this might work for
small-scale pieces of work, it is no way to conduct product development
in a professional organisation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Being more Agile doesn’t mean allowing the engineering function to
become a developer playground with no rules. The consequences of
an emergent architecture are a total lack of predictability in delivery.
Discovering that you must support 10,000 users after six months of
development work, requiring a complete change of the technology stack,
isn’t the kind of problem most organisations can swallow.</p>
<p>In general terms, when developing a new product, the architecture for
the MVP is defined upfront and tested against the core business goals
using PoCs and prototypes during Discovery. This provides a level of
predictability and reduced delivery risk during the implementation of
the initial product version. Solution architecture is largely impacted by
the non-functional requirements of the product, so early emphasis on
getting these agreed is important.</p>
<p>Engineering Quality Outcomes 201</p>
<p><strong>Figure 8-2: Architecture Definition</strong></p>
<p>It would be naïve to assume that architecture is defined 100% upfront
without subsequent modification. The architecture of the product will
continue to change as the product changes, particularly post-launch.</p>
<p>Updates to the product architecture occur through controlled evolution
and not emergence. Significant architectural changes can cause
widespread disruption to the delivery pipeline if not managed correctly.
In extreme cases, we have seen this completely halt delivery of
functional change.</p>
<p>The process of making architectural change is a surgical procedure
and is largely the same irrespective of where in the architecture the
change is - business, application, data or technology. The change will
likely comprise a large-scale code change, service integration, potential
technology change, and a modification to the delivery pipeline.</p>

</code></pre><p>202 Engineering Quality Outcomes</p>
<p>Strong engineering principles executed through good configuration
management, source code control and branch and merge policies are
essential. The key steps are:</p>
<p><strong>1. Identification of requirement for architectural change leads to a</strong>
    **PoC to confirm the approach</p>
<ol>
<li>Architectural change is undertaken in a separate code branch to<strong>
 </strong>avoid impacting normal functional delivery</li>
<li>The change is merged back into the pipeline when complete or<strong>
 </strong>ideally periodically where this is feasible.**</li>
</ol>
<p>Technical change is only committed to the delivery pipeline and
shippable product when all assurance and tests have been completed.
Technical changes should never break the pipeline or impact
product quality.</p>
<p>Given the serious problems that technical changes can bring, we
recommend always following these rules:</p>
<p><strong>1. There are written requirements and acceptance criteria in the</strong>
    **same way as for functional change</p>
<ol>
<li>Change is only made when it adds value to the organisation (this<strong>
 </strong>may be indirect, e.g., improving the efficiency of the team)</li>
<li>Implementation is undertaken by the Product Team, not by the<strong>
 </strong>most experienced person.**</li>
</ol>
<p>The last point may seem counter-intuitive, but there will be long term
consequences for knowledge and morale if the perceived ‘hard’ technical
work is the preserve of an elite. The Product Team need to be able to
know how to continue to change and run the product.</p>
<p>Engineering Quality Outcomes 203</p>
<h3 id="measure-for-success">Measure for Success</h3>
<p>To aid predictable delivery and continuously improve, it is essential to
put in place the right measures around delivering change and service.
We believe that metrics collection and reporting should largely be
automated by the lifecycle tooling. It is also important that there is
complete transparency over the metrics from the team all the way up to
the sponsor.</p>
<p>There is considerable debate amongst the Agile community as to
how, and if, teams should be measured. In many ways, excessive
measurement is counter to the spirit of Agile development, but in
scenarios where large-scale change is being delivered, measurement is
essential. It is vital to gain the trust of the team by being transparent
about what metrics are being collected and what they are used for.</p>
<h3 id="engineering-good-customer-service">Engineering Good Customer Service</h3>
<p>A key component of delivering complete Product Increments is the
Service Wrap - the processes and procedures that support the user
when experiencing difficulty using the product.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the service component of product delivery has been
separated from the development efforts to change the product. To
be effective at rapid low-risk change we believe that ‘Build’ and ‘Run’
should be combined. <strong>Chapter 9</strong> provides a description of this approach
and how Agile and ITIL can co-exist in a single DevOps delivery unit.</p>
<p>204 Engineering Quality Outcomes</p>
<h2 id="the-enterprise-agile-approach">The Enterprise Agile Approach</h2>
<h3 id="building-the-delivery-pipeline">Building the Delivery Pipeline</h3>
<p>The delivery pipeline - the technology and tooling through which new
Product Increments flow - is core to delivering technology change.
Establishing the basic delivery pipeline at the start of delivery is an
essential investment. Without it, the process of delivering change relies
on manual processes, poor testing coverage and a collection of error-
prone and time-consuming scripts.</p>
<p>At the heart of the delivery pipeline is an integrated toolchain. These
engineering tools should support all aspects of building and running
the product. Getting these products up and running from the start of
product delivery is strongly recommended. However, it is possible to add
to existing product delivery where this hasn’t been used in the past. On
larger scale Product Teams it is sometimes the case that a specialist
team (or individual) looks after tooling. This is a judgment call - we
suggest that all engineers should have a good working knowledge of the
tooling and how it fits together.</p>

<p>206 Engineering Quality Outcomes</p>
<h3 id="operating-and-improving-the-delivery-pipeline">Operating and Improving the Delivery Pipeline</h3>
<p>Time should be allowed both pre- and post-product launch to maintain
and improve the delivery pipeline. This is also a good time to catalogue
tech debt and prioritise it against new functionality or support issues.
Doing so preserves the efficiency of the team and reduces the risk of
failures. Required changes to the pipeline are most likely to originate
from the team themselves during their normal Stand-ups and
Retrospectives. These changes should be recorded as defects or
new stories and added to the backlog. They are then prioritised and
fed into the normal Sprint planning process against reserved
maintenance capacity.</p>
<p>If the pipeline becomes faulty then delivery should stop. A big mistake
we see teams make in this situation is carrying on. If the continuous
integration process or automated tests are not working, the team must
halt all feature delivery and concentrate on fixing the problem. Without
the correct controls in place, there is no knowing what the product
quality is. Furthermore, if tests are failing, continuing to change and add
new areas of untested functionality to the product will compound the
problem. If the build breaks, the pipeline is faulty and normal delivery
stops – no excuses. Ever!</p>
<p>We expect instrumentation to be applied in production and to the
delivery pipeline. Sudden increases in build times, test execution times,
etc. may point to a problem that will soon impact productivity. Such
issues should be recorded and dealt with as potential defects in the
same way as product defects. Remember, the delivery pipeline is the
vehicle for implementing technology change - it needs maintaining and
repairing to continue to be successful.</p>
<p>Engineering Quality Outcomes 207</p>
<h3 id="building-in-product-quality">Building in Product Quality</h3>
<p>Product quality is ‘engineered in’ throughout the delivery process. It
cannot be easily ‘tested in’ afterwards. This requires a clear approach
to testing that ensures potential issues are identified early. It is only
through these (largely automated) test activities that a DevOps approach
can succeed.</p>
<p>Pushing frequent change through the delivery pipeline and into the
hands of the users requires assurance that things aren’t going to
break. Test activities evolve across the product lifecycle as shown
in <strong>Figure 8-4.</strong></p>
<p>It is important to recognise that everyone is engaged in quality and test
activities and that this is integral to the work of each team. The focus on
testing begins at the outset and helps shape the realisation of the initial
idea. Early consideration of test activities is essential to the delivery of
a quality product. The first areas to consider are how the delivery of the
product can be assured and the role that testing plays in this. The initial
approach will consider the required test activities, levels of automation,
framework, roles, environments and data.</p>

<h3 id="developing-a-strategy-for-testing">Developing a Strategy for Testing</h3>
<p>Using a test strategy is a powerful way to capture and focus energy on
test activities. Exhaustively testing (manual or automated) all aspects of
the product following a change is not feasible. An effective test strategy
understands what test coverage is sufficient and directs efforts to test
objectives where they are most needed based on risk and effectiveness.</p>
<p>Ultimately, testing aims to ensure the product can be released to users
with a reasonable level of predictability and quality. A good test strategy
will include the following key elements:</p>
<p><strong>1. Test Objectives</strong> - Shaping the balance of testing methods
    employed and the focus of the team is derived from clear test
    objectives. This is likely to reflect the acceptable risk profile and
    external constraints such as compliance
<strong>2. Contribution to Governance</strong> - Product quality is one of the key
    measures of interest to stakeholders. The output of test activities
    must be articulated crisply and concisely, such that it can inform
    any required support or interventions</p>
<p>210 Engineering Quality Outcomes</p>
<p><strong>3. Information Sharing</strong> - The entire Product Team relies on data
    relating to testing to help focus its efforts, so clarity here is
    important. Issues arising during testing may point to the need
    to address skills and capability within the team or resolve
    design problems
<strong>4. Test Architecture</strong> - This may sound a rather grand term, but it is
    important to consider how test activities interact and overlap. Test
    architecture will capture the structure of the testing landscape and
    identify the supporting frameworks and tools required
<strong>5. Test Method</strong> - Consideration must be given to how the testing will
    take place and the execution process, the level of automation and
    the underpinning data and environments that will be used. This
    will help the team plan test tasks and interactions across
    the organisation.</p>
<p>Engineering Quality Outcomes 211</p>
<h3 id="determining-where-to-focus-test-effort">Determining Where to Focus Test Effort</h3>
<p>Creating automated tests is a significant investment. Not only does
creating the tests require engineering skill and labour, but every product
change will require further tests and updates to existing tests. When
creating a test strategy and considering where to invest in automation,
we find the Agile test automation pyramid in <strong>Figure 8-5</strong> useful. This
identifies that the bulk of automation effort should be focused on unit
tests ahead of service (API) tests and UI automation.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 8-5: Agile Test Automation Pyramid</strong></p>
<pre><code>UI

</code></pre><pre><code>Unit
(<span class="hljs-number">40</span><span class="hljs-number">-60</span>%)
</code></pre><p>212 Engineering Quality Outcomes</p>
<p>This approach offers several clear advantages. Firstly, it builds quality
into the product from within. Traditional test approaches might have a
team of people or large automation packs created by testers focused
on the interface and not the implementation. Secondly, relying on big
UI automation packs is inefficient - they quickly become brittle and are
costly to maintain.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the bias towards unit and service tests pushes the bulk of test
automation back into the development space, forcing developers to
own product quality which has a general overall positive effect. It also
broadens the responsibility to Business Analysts, who must ensure edge
conditions are well understood and covered.</p>
<p>It is common to see the pyramid model extended to cover additional
test phases and also suggest the level of effort to be expended on
manual testing. An example of an enhanced test pyramid is shown
in <strong>Figure 8-6</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="a-structured-approach-to-testing">A Structured Approach to Testing</h3>
<p>In <strong>Chapter 6</strong> we discussed the importance of a structured approach
to Analysis. For obvious reasons, validating that layered requirements
have been met necessitates a layered approach to testing. This yields
consideration for the established V-model. The concept of the V-model
was originally coupled to more traditional Waterfall projects. However,
the principle can still apply to an Agile delivery with the ‘V’ repeated
every Sprint (or set of Sprints forming a release). We refer to this as
the W-model.</p>

<p>In devising the approach to testing, the team must consider the balance
of requirements-based testing and risk-based testing. Both have a
part to play in ensuring product quality. All stories will be written with
acceptance criteria that need to be tested against; this should be a
joint activity by Developers and Business Analysts to ensure the right
coverage and that both business and technical criteria are included.
Further testing beyond that and into obscure edge cases should be
driven by risk.</p>
<p>It is useful (not just from a testing perspective) to know what the
most frequent and most valuable transactions in the product are. This
information can be used to help prioritise testing efforts.</p>
<h3 id="test-phases-and-the-sprint-pattern">Test Phases and the Sprint Pattern</h3>
<p>We expect that meeting the acceptance criteria defined for each user
story is part of the Definition of Done. This correctly implies that story
acceptance testing will take place during the same Sprint as the story is
developed. Where the change is relatively small, it should be possible to
conclude all necessary testing during a Sprint. The automated delivery
pipeline assures this and uses packs of automated tests to allow
software to be deployed at the touch of a button.</p>
<p>Engineering Quality Outcomes 215</p>
<p>There are of course valid exceptions to this process. Many of the
systems we work with require further manual testing or integration with
non-Agile workstreams and legacy systems. In such scenarios, these test
phases may occur in parallel to ongoing feature development or during a
special purpose Release Sprint. <strong>Figure 8-8</strong> illustrates the test phases we
recommend and how this is achieved across the delivery pattern.</p>

<h3 id="dealing-with-defects">Dealing with Defects</h3>
<p>No matter how extensive testing efforts are, defects and support
incidents will arise. This should be a matter of routine and a large ‘bow
wave’ of defects must not be allowed to accumulate near a release by
watering down the Definition of Done or deferring testing. This is why we
recommend as much testing occurs in-Sprint as possible and the full
Product Increment is produced such that application, infrastructure and
data change are aligned and fully working together.</p>
<p>Defects and support work will be added to the product backlog and
brought into Sprint through the Sprint planning process and delivered
alongside new stories. It is unlikely that all defects to be fixed in a Sprint
are discussed at the planning meeting. A more common approach is to
allow for some team capacity to address defects in priority order.</p>
<p>To ensure that defects are properly understood and assigned the correct
severity rating, teams should run a regular defect triage meeting with
the Product Owner. This session not only ensures that defects are
categorised and dealt with correctly but also allows for the removal of
duplicates and the identification of trends in particular types of defects.</p>
<h3 id="developing-for-the-cloud">Developing for the Cloud</h3>
<p>Since the first edition of this book in 2008, the infrastructure world has
changed considerably. We’ve seen a significant change from physical
infrastructure, to private virtual infrastructure, to Cloud-based virtual
infrastructure and now to global Cloud platforms. In the early days of
Public Cloud, we used these Cloud services to mimic traditional
on-premise architectures. This reduced the start-up time of a project.
It is possible to use infrastructure automation tools to spin up a delivery
pipeline and test environments in Sprint 0. It is possible to use the same
scripts to build the production environments, minimising configuration
drift and helping to reduce the time from development to release.</p>
<p>Engineering Quality Outcomes 217</p>
<p>Containers and container platforms have moved from developer
platforms to reliable production platforms. Containers are an ideal
platform for microservices architectures and have brought new ways
of thinking and a new vocabulary to the development and release of
software. For example, the concept of ‘pets’ versus ‘cattle’ (where
servers are either beloved, named ‘pets’ nursed back to health
if they go down, or one of many numbered ‘cattle’ in a herd that
are replaced if they go down) takes advantage of comprehensive
automation to simplify fault handling and is one of the cornerstones
of self-healing architectures.</p>
<p>Another advantage of containers is that it brings the configuration closer
to the developer and puts the configuration code into the developer’s
domain. This is the same code repository as the application code and
allows the images they create to be part of the continuous delivery
pipeline. This ensures that the infrastructure can be proven earlier.</p>
<p>Now that the main Public Cloud vendors offer serverless computing,
solutions no longer require virtual infrastructure or container platforms</p>
<ul>
<li>although they are still available if required. As the name suggests, with
serverless computing there is no server to manage. Code is deployed
to the service and executed in response to events (such as RESTful API
requests, messages arriving into a queue, or time-based schedules.) A
complete system can be built using serverless computing or it can be
combined with containers, virtual infrastructure or on-premise systems
for a hybrid solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>With each of the above options, the cycle time from define to operate
(see ‘Building the Delivery Pipeline’) can be reduced significantly using
Cloud technologies. For ‘born in the Cloud’ companies, this is their
‘normal’, and their ability to innovate, test their ideas, and keep moving
forward far exceeds that of companies with legacy infrastructure and
architectures. Companies with legacy systems and infrastructure looking
to adopt Enterprise Agility must evaluate how Cloud technologies can
be integrated into their current systems, architectures and processes to
support them on their journey.</p>
<p>218 Engineering Quality Outcomes</p>
<h3 id="delivery-and-service-metrics">Delivery and Service Metrics</h3>
<p>If you want to improve something - measure it. We are strong advocates
of implementing metrics to understand the performance of the product
and the delivery pipeline. There are typically three categories of metrics
that arise from DevOps around a product; these are summarised
in <strong>Figure 8-9</strong>.</p>
<p>The collection and distribution of metrics should be largely automated.
We expect this to be part of the end-to-end toolchain. Getting data
should not be a chore, but it does require a little support across the
team. In particular, those responsible for delivering change will need to
record the actual time spent on tasks and estimated time to completion.
This enables the rate of delivery and estimation accuracy to be recorded
and used as part of the feedback loop to adjust the forward plan and
advise the Sprint planning process.</p>

<p>Engineering Quality Outcomes 219</p>
<p>The ultimate measure for the organisation is earned value and measuring
the benefit gained for the effort expended on delivering new features.</p>
<p>Service metrics inform decisions about staffing levels in Support Teams
and highlight the quality of service being delivered to users. They also
quantify how the platform has been scaling to user needs and the
potential cost implications of that scaling.</p>
<p>Measuring product quality is important to ensure that customer
expectations continue to be met and product quality remains high. This
can be measured by examining defect levels and the stability/availability
of the product.</p>
<p>We suggest that a metrics dashboard, transparent and visible to all team
members, is produced dynamically from the pipeline tooling.</p>
<h3 id="measuring-change">Measuring Change</h3>
<p>A crucial element of achieving predictability is measuring progress
towards the next release and any impediments to this. Many Agile
methodologies have devised different ways of achieving this. Measuring
velocity (the rate at which work is done) and Burn-down (or Burn-up)
charts are common. The challenge is avoiding getting bound up in lots
of metrics while having sufficient information to make decisions and
interventions as required. It is also important the metrics tell a story,
have an appropriate narrative and are not just raw data. Reporting to a
senior executive that the team has a velocity of 27 isn’t helpful.</p>
<p>Within a Sprint, we believe in recording progress using a Burn-down
chart. This is because the content of a Sprint should be a fixed scope</p>
<ul>
<li>the stories taken into Sprint during the planning session. An example
Burn-down chart is provided in <strong>Figure 8-10</strong>. The Burn-down chart should
be updated daily as a result of the Stand-up and a revised estimate to
complete on tasks by engineers.</li>
</ul>
<p>220 Engineering Quality Outcomes</p>

</code></pre><pre><code><span class="hljs-attribute">Actual</span>
</code></pre><pre><code><span class="hljs-attribute">Plan</span>
</code></pre><p>The Burn-down is calculated by plotting the estimate to complete for
all the tasks in the Sprint. For tasks in progress, this is updated daily
by engineers in the Delivery Team. For tasks not yet started, this is the
estimate from the Sprint planning session. This actual Burn-down is
compared to an ideal trend line that shows all tasks completing by the
end of the Sprint. Note that the estimate for complete for a story should
only reach zero when it meets the Definition of Done.</p>
<p>A release may occur after one or more Sprints. For a release, we
recommend using a Burn-up chart because the scope of a release can
change over time as stories move in or out of the release through the
Sprint planning process. As can be seen in <strong>Figure 8-11</strong> , the Burn-up
release chart clearly identifies a baseline scope for the release. In the
case of an MVP, this will be the scope agreed during Discovery.</p>
<p>Engineering Quality Outcomes 221</p>
<p>The Burn-up should reflect actual work completed to the Definition
of Done. It might be useful to plot the Burn-up for each layer in the
Definition of Done to be sure that a gap is not opening up between work
completed by the team and being accepted by the user community.</p>

</code></pre><p>The concept of earned value is important here. Tracking effort, work
done, velocity and so on is useful as an indicator and to aid planning,
but most executive sponsors are interested in understanding progress
towards goals. If the initiative needs to build 10 widgets to derive value
for the organisation, then the only thing that matters is how many
widgets are completed. In addition to monitoring completed stories
against the baseline, we also suggest plotting the actual and planned
resource capacity.</p>
<p>222 Engineering Quality Outcomes</p>
<p>Inevitably, if progress deviates from the expectation, questions will
rightly be asked. Often, the root cause is simply a lack of bandwidth
within the team due to unexpected urgent or critical faults that the
Development Team needs to address, as well as factors like unforeseen
holidays and sickness. It is best to make this easily visible, so that
further analysis into potential issues is only required when the most
probable cause of a bandwidth issue is ruled out.</p>
<p><strong>Measuring Service</strong></p>
<p>Service metrics inform stakeholders about the performance of the
product in live use and the level of support being provided. Much of our
thinking on service metrics is informed by ITIL processes, combined
with the application of a ‘Necessary and Sufficient’ filter. As a minimum,
service metrics must cover:</p>
<p><strong>1. Usage of the product by the various user communities.</strong>
    Often this is a non-functional requirement anyway and is certainly
    important in gaining insight into the interactions of users with the
    product to inform future enhancements
<strong>2. Incidents arising from the usage of the system and how the</strong>
    <strong>resolution of these performs against any agreed service levels.</strong>
    Incidents will typically be assigned severity levels and the
    investigation of these may lead to a defect being passed back to
    the Delivery Teams
<strong>3. Capacity that is utilised to deliver the service.</strong>
    This is important for forward planning and financial management
    and to some extent goes hand in hand with the usage metrics in
    point 1. These metrics are particularly important when not using
    elastic Cloud computing platforms.</p>
<p>As with delivery metrics relating to change, we would expect these
metrics to be largely automated and derived from the tooling in the
delivery pipeline and used by the Service Teams.</p>
<p>Engineering Quality Outcomes 223</p>
<p><strong>Measuring Quality</strong></p>
<p>An important set of metrics are those referring to quality. During the
execution of change and service, it is important to track the defects
found and their path to resolution. We also believe that measuring
system availability and unplanned outages is a good indicator of
production quality. Many theories and convoluted metrics exist in the
area of product quality. We prefer to keep things straightforward and
put in place only the ‘Necessary and Sufficient’ metrics.</p>
<p>The number of defects alone does not tell a story or convey any
meaningful information. Our recommended key defect metrics are
the find and fix rates. These should be plotted over time to provide
historical trends. The key question to address is ‘Are more defects
being found and is resolution keeping pace with Discovery?’ Ensuring
that a significant gap does not open up between the find and fix rate
is key to ensuring a ‘No surprises endgame’ for the release of a
Product Increment.</p>

<h3 id="assuring-technical-quality">Assuring Technical Quality</h3>
<p>Technical Leads will typically develop and implement a Technical
Quality Plan (TQP) to underpin the quality of the engineering efforts.
The purpose of this TQP is to ensure that all technical output meets the
required quality standard. Its scope will include application software,
infrastructure (software-defined and hardware), test assets and the full
engineering stack.</p>
<p>The TQP should be considered a living artefact that evolves with the
product. It is also important to recognise that the document or wiki
that represents the TQP is not an end in itself, but a means to an end</p>
<ul>
<li>high-quality technical output. The key areas covered by the TQP are:
<strong>1. Delivery Pipeline Quality</strong> - The section refers to the use of the
  delivery pipeline and how to manage the quality of setup and
  maintenance, including build, continuous integration, packaging
  and deployment
<strong>2. Code Quality</strong> - All aspects of managing the quality of code should
  be addressed. This will extend to peer code review, static analysis,
  coding standards, managing technical debt and documentation
<strong>3. Product Quality</strong> - This complements the test approach and
  determines from a technical perspective what ‘Good’ looks like
  and how to make effective use of the test tools and frameworks
  available. Typically, this will cover unit test and automated
  end-to-end tests</li>
</ul>
<p>226 Engineering Quality Outcomes</p>
<p><strong>4. Technical Risk Management</strong> - This defines a process for identifying
    and managing technical risks associated with delivering and
    running the product. This will dovetail into the standard RAID log
    for overall product delivery
<strong>5. Knowledge Management</strong> - An approach is required for capturing,
    maintaining and sharing technical information relating to the
    product. This will include code comments, wikis and
    traditional documentation.</p>
<h3 id="do-everything-continuously">Do Everything Continuously</h3>
<p>Do everything continuously to ensure quality is engineered-in and

<h3 id="no-service">No Service</h3>
<p>The notion of a product having no service is illusory – if an organisation
is using software to conduct elements of its business then a service
is being provided. Whilst this scenario may seem unlikely in a modern
delivery environment, in our experience it is surprisingly common,
particularly in the less mainstream areas of a portfolio. It is not
uncommon for key production systems to be well defined and managed,
whilst other services, perhaps dependencies of that key system, are
largely ignored. As a result, ‘no service’ services may be responsible for
significant business risk.</p>
<p>A legacy system may be in constant use and have experienced no
issues for long periods. Nevertheless, a failure would have significant
consequences. A common scenario we see is a small number of people
managing high-value transactions using extremely complex spreadsheet
solutions. In many cases, these solutions, now operating as key services
within the business, have been created by Subject Matter Expert (SME)
staff who have long since moved on. A faulty formula, a regulatory or
business change, unforeseen circumstances in the data or technical
changes to an unseen dependency can have a significant impact (real
or reported).</p>

<p>In an ad-hoc services approach, the delivery organisation recognises that
a service is being provided, but the ways of working are poorly defined.</p>
<p>A common scenario is that of a project never quite closing down - an
otherwise well-managed and well-defined delivery project with poorly
defined or non-existent terms of reference for the production system.
This often means that the original Engineering Team that built the
solution (the people best placed to support it) remains responsible for
resolving any issues, even after the project has disbanded.</p>
<p>Service Agility 233</p>
<p>This approach works well in mitigating risk, particularly in the
early stages of a new service, but it must be a conscious strategy,
managed carefully.</p>
<p>It’s often the case that the Engineers able to support the new service
are planned into their next delivery. Diverting them to address second
and third line support issues, which usually attract higher priority than
project delivery, is disruptive. This unplanned competition for resources
creates barriers between teams, friction between colleagues and
demotivates the people involved.</p>
<p>Despite these issues, small Engineering Teams with a clear delineation
of responsibility and an ‘eyes open’ approach to planning and estimation
can operate this model quite successfully. It is often effective where
there is a single point of responsibility able to address any intra-team
tensions. For example, a single Delivery Manager responsible for Service
A and Project B can set direction between the two without recourse to
committee decision making.</p>
<p>Operating a service like this at scale is more difficult. Services of this
type tend to over-emphasise the team’s project domain knowledge,
which naturally erodes over time as the team evolves due to attrition or
reorganisation. This approach can breed single points of failure, allowing
key person dependencies within the project to extend to the service
regime with the attendant risks that this brings.</p>

<p>Continuous Improvement</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-keyword">Strategy </span>Design Transition Operation
</code></pre><h3 id="managed-service">Managed Service</h3>
<p>Mature service organisations typically employ a service management
framework of some kind. Many standards and frameworks exist,
including the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL), the
international standard ISO/IEC 20000, the IT governance framework
Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies (COBIT) and
elements of The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF).</p>
<p>The most widely used service management framework is ITIL, first
developed in the 1980s by the CCTA. The concepts are split into several
core areas, as summarised in <strong>Figure 9-2</strong>.</p>
<p>Service Agility 235</p>
<p>IT service management best practices are the activities, processes and
procedures that an organisation adopts to align IT services with the
needs of the business. The key elements are:</p>
<p><strong>Service Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Service strategy includes, but isn’t limited to, Service Portfolio
Management, Financial Management for IT Services, Demand
Management, and Business Relationship Management.</p>
<p><strong>Service Design</strong></p>
<p>In this context, service design considers Service Catalogue Management,
Service Level Management, Availability Management, Capacity
Management, IT Service Continuity Management, Security Management,
and Supplier Management.</p>
<p>Using these broad concepts as dimensions, comprehensive service
processes can be designed (including supporting procedures),
dependencies can be understood, and a service design can be developed
and communicated.</p>
<p>This aspect of service design differs from the service design discussed
in the Human-Centred Design chapter, which focuses on the design of
services from a user perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Service Transition</strong></p>
<p>Service transition covers not only the transition of new services into a
production setting but also ongoing changes to the live service, including
release and deployment good practice. It includes Transition Planning
and Support, Change, Service Asset and Configuration Management,</p>
<p>236 Service Agility</p>
<p>Release and Deployment Management, Service Validation and Testing,
Change Evaluation, and Knowledge Management.</p>
<p><strong>Service Operation</strong></p>
<p>Service operation covers the areas familiar to most organisations
because these processes and functions are the ones they work
with every day. These include Service Desk, Technical Management
Application Management, and IT Operations Management. Service
operation also covers the processes that deal with Event, Access,
Request Fulfilment, Incident and Problem Management.</p>
<p><strong>Continual Service Improvement</strong></p>
<p>The final, overarching core area is Continual Service Improvement.
This is an important aspect of any service management approach and
ITIL’s version covers, amongst other things, a seven-step improvement
process to enable a service to change with the evolving needs of
the business.</p>
<p>Like any framework, ITIL has strengths and weaknesses, but it is
important to understand the basics. Many books have been written on
the various versions of ITIL, and we don’t propose to duplicate them
here. However, the concepts are key to any structured approach to
service management.</p>

<h2 id="bjss-opinion">BJSS Opinion</h2>
<p>A structured service management approach is sometimes seen by those
who don’t understand it as a hindrance in Agile environments. Often,
it is perceived to be an unforgiving, unbending process. This is usually
because the details of the service design are not fit for purpose. Many
organisations implement what they believe to be best practice but do
not take into account the needs of the organisation or the speed of
change to which it aspires. Note that the design may well have been fit
for purpose at the stage it was put in place, but evolving business needs
have not been reflected or considered over time.</p>
<p>Service management should be at the heart of an Agile delivery from
the outset. It is unlikely that the service representative will shape the
product, but they can advise on potential service options that influence
decision making before requirements are finalised.</p>
<p>Service design will be heavily influenced by the organisation’s appetite
for automation. If automation and quality are built-in as part of the
development of the product and infrastructure, service processes can
be more lightweight, and speed of delivery enhanced.</p>
<p>As with any other Agile process, once service processes are agreed upon
and implemented, they should be refined and reviewed continually.
What is relevant in an early life support stage may be irrelevant when
the product has proved itself to be stable and resilient. For example, as
confidence in the automation grows, along with service maturity, what
would once be counted as a change requiring Change Advisory Board
approval will become a standard change and be pre-approved.</p>
<p>Service Agility 239</p>
<p>A common misconception is that all best practice service management
processes should be in place at go-live. In practice, this depends on
the type of project and any external factors. In some circumstances
it may be appropriate to design a Minimum Viable Service (MVS) that
includes only:</p>
<p><strong>○ Incident Management</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Change Management</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Release Management</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Event Management.</strong></p>
<p>Other processes can be implemented while the product is live and
designed and enhanced in parallel to the product development.</p>
<h3 id="meeting-the-challenge">Meeting the Challenge</h3>
<p>Delivering an effective service is not straightforward. Challenges include:</p>
<p><strong>○ Complex, evolving IT estates with multiple component parts</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Ageing technical infrastructure and legacy applications</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Legacy or niche technologies making it difficult (expensive!) to
retain skilled staff</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ No agreed to service levels (Operational Level Agreements) with an
internal team or between teams</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ No journey/plan to modernisation - service designed to ‘keep the
lights on’</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ IT services failing to meet the need of the organisation.</strong></p>
<p>240 Service Agility</p>
<p>In our experience, these obstacles can exist even in organisations with
a mature approach to service delivery and a clear understanding of their
end goal.</p>
<p>Improvements can always be made, regardless of where an organisation
fits on the maturity scale. An Agile approach will help with an
incremental migration to a more mature approach.</p>
<h3 id="engineering-good-customer-service">Engineering Good Customer Service</h3>
<p>ITIL processes typically dominate the service space and, although ITIL is
still relevant, modern engineering techniques built on software-defined
infrastructure and Cloud computing should be used to automate many
of these processes.</p>
<p><strong>Service Design</strong></p>
<p><strong>Service Catalogue Management</strong></p>
<p>Likely, the product can automatically register its services to maintain
a catalogue.</p>
<p><strong>Service Level Management</strong></p>
<p>The Agile and DevOps approaches described throughout this book
includes this process. Consideration should be given to service levels
when using public Cloud platforms, as they may not offer guaranteed
“classic” service levels such as availability and performance. When
it comes to Agile and Cloud development, the service level should
be considered as part of the initial design, and techniques such as
automated horizontal and vertical scaling should be explored.</p>
<p>Service Agility 241</p>
<p><strong>Capacity Management</strong></p>
<p>Whilst it is useful to understand underlying platform constraints and
costs, we would expect the delivered product to automatically scale
network, compute, and storage as required using Cloud technologies.
The shift towards Cloud technologies may reduce the significance of
capacity management, but the greater emphasis should be given to
budget management and commercial offerings of the Cloud suppliers.</p>
<p><strong>Availability Management</strong></p>
<p>Using serverless computing, scalable microservices, automated
provisioning, monitoring, and self-healing should allow for a product
to be almost always available. The near-limitless availability of Cloud
services also provides the ability to test this availability using manual
or automated test techniques. The use of automated techniques largely
reduces the need for manual approaches.</p>
<p><strong>Service Continuity Management</strong></p>
<p>Disaster recovery and service continuity is designed during Discovery,
and should be fully automated within the product delivery.</p>
<p><strong>Information Security Management</strong></p>
<p>A secure coding lifecycle should be adopted to ensure compliance
with information security standards. When using Cloud services, the
possibility of using hosted security management tools should also
be explored.</p>
<p><strong>Supplier Management</strong></p>
<p>Safeguarding the commercial interests of the organisation and ensuring
that suppliers are aligned to project goals is the responsibility of the
Product Team.</p>
<p>242 Service Agility</p>
<p><strong>Service Transition</strong></p>
<p><strong>Knowledge Management</strong></p>
<p>Product information should be maintained by the team as part of the
ongoing service of the product.</p>
<p><strong>Change Management</strong></p>
<p>The rollout of change is completely automated, as is the generation of
information allowing complete traceability of the contents of the change.
In most organisations, a Developer check-in will not automatically deploy
to live, and a final manual Go/No-go decision is made by the Change
Advisory Board. As the organisation matures in its ability to deploy
changes more frequently, the governance around change management
should also evolve.</p>
<p><strong>Asset and Configuration Management</strong></p>
<p>When using a software-defined infrastructure, the content management
database (CMDB) can be automatically generated by inventory scanning
tools. With immutable infrastructure and Cloud platform services,
the maintenance of a traditional CMDB can become a considerable
overhead, and Leaner approaches to Asset and Configuration
management should be explored as part of the delivery phase.
Where possible, all configuration, infrastructure, documentation,
and application code, should be stored centrally in the source code
control repository.</p>
<p><strong>Release and Deployment</strong></p>
<p>It is expected that the release and deployment process is fully
automated by the delivery pipeline. This removes one of the biggest
headaches of implementing change, where often manual, error-prone
steps are used to install software products.</p>
<p>Service Agility 243</p>
<p><strong>Transition Planning</strong></p>
<p>In a large change, such as the implementation of a new product, some
manual transition planning work is still required.</p>
<p><strong>Service Validation and Testing</strong></p>
<p>A suite of automated tests should be used to ensure that the product
operates effectively and that automated health checks and healing
services operate correctly. Some work will be required to check the
results of this process and align any remaining manual tests.</p>
<p><strong>Process Evaluation</strong></p>
<p>The process evaluation category is still potentially useful. We would
expect the service to mature through the Agile change process outlined
in this book. This will be supplemented by audits of the remaining
manual processes.</p>
<p><strong>Service Operations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Incident Management</strong></p>
<p>Incident management and dealing with end-users will still require
human intervention. The investment in an approach to meeting
user needs and user-centred design will mean that user queries are
reduced. In addition, the focus on automated testing and self-healing
infrastructure should mean that reported failures decline as product
reliability increases.</p>
<p>244 Service Agility</p>
<p><strong>Problem Management</strong></p>
<p>Problem management will still require work from the Support Teams.
These are the challenges that go beyond the automated repair
mechanisms of the product.</p>
<p><strong>Access Management</strong></p>
<p>This security-enforcing function likely remains manual.</p>
<p><strong>Event Management</strong></p>
<p>The end-to-end toolchain will include operational tools to monitor the
health of the product. Events such as low free storage or node failures
can be automatically fixed by a self-healing platform and automatically
reported to the incident management tool.</p>
<p><strong>Request Fulfilment</strong></p>
<p>By using software-defined infrastructure in the Cloud, Engineers can
provision the required infrastructure. Little manual work is required, but
someone needs to keep an eye on the finances!</p>
<p><strong>Continual Service Improvement</strong></p>
<p><strong>Service Measurement</strong></p>
<p>It is recommended that service metrics are automatically generated by
the platform.</p>
<p><strong>Service Reporting</strong></p>
<p>While service reporting can largely be automated, human interpretation
of the reports is required to determine any intervention required.</p>
<p>Service Agility 245</p>
<p><strong>Service Improvement</strong></p>
<p>The service improvement step is still usefully a manual process but
should be tied into the Sprint ceremonies.</p>
<h2 id="the-enterprise-agile-approach">The Enterprise Agile Approach</h2>
<p>Implementing a Service Wrap is key to realising the benefits of good
service management practice. The Enterprise Agile approach to
delivering the Service Wrap is straightforward – treat it as a product to
be delivered like any other.</p>
<h3 id="service-agility-at-10-000-feet">Service Agility at 10,000 feet</h3>
<p>The Enterprise Agile approach to service management embraces a
DevOps philosophy. Continuous Delivery and cross-functional ways of
working are key to delivering Agility in the Service Wrap. This way of
working breaks the traditional ‘Build’ and ‘Run’ ways of thinking.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 9-4</strong> shows the traditional approach to service management,
based on a ‘complete’ product being handed over to an Operations
organisation to run the service. Future changes are bundled up into a
notional ‘Release 2’ or series of releases.</p>
<p>246 Service Agility</p>

</code></pre><p>But how does this approach work with a Minimum Viable Product
(MVP)? What if the MVP has limited scope and could be earning value
for the organisation very quickly, despite substantially more functionality
remaining in the product backlog? The project is not finished, but the
Product must be run.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 9-5</strong> illustrates the Enterprise Agile service model.</p>
<p>248 Service Agility</p>
<p>As soon as the MVP is launched into production, a service is being
provided or value cannot be earned. This has several implications for
the delivery. Service must be considered upfront, with a ‘Necessary and
Sufficient’ Service Wrap in place. The key point here is ‘Necessary and
Sufficient’ – just as a Minimum Viable Product implements a subset
of the product backlog, a Minimum Viable Service (MVS) approach can
implement an appropriate subset of the Service Wrap.</p>
<p>Thinking about the core concepts, expected usage, and ways of working
for the MVP helps inform the MVS. In particular, do not underestimate
the challenge of managing a team to provide a production-quality
Managed Service in parallel with the delivery of the next wave of
features from the product backlog.</p>
<p>Embracing automation as part of the delivery of the MVP, and
considering this as part of the strategy and design of the Service Wrap
from Discovery onwards, provides the right platform for Agility in the
service. The concept of ‘Release 2’ becomes irrelevant when changes
to the product – and associated service – can be delivered on a
Sprint-by-Sprint basis.</p>
<p>We believe that, wherever possible, the teams that build an MVP should
provide the MVS. Using a DevOps way of working completely removes the
‘us and them’ of traditional Build and Run Teams.</p>
<h3 id="anatomy-of-a-service-wrap">Anatomy of a Service Wrap</h3>
<p>The Enterprise Agile Service Wrap is a structured approach to good
industry practice, drawing on ITIL, with Agility at its core.</p>
<p>The Service Wrap provides the people, skills, processes, and tooling
required to allow the MVP and subsequent Product Increments to earn
business value.</p>
<p>Service Agility 249</p>
<p><strong>Figure 9-6: Enterprise Agile Service Wrap</strong></p>
<p>A Service Wrap typically comprises several key capabilities: Platform,
Application Support and Maintenance, and New Business Services. The
mix will vary for each Service Wrap depending on the unique needs of
the underlying Product.</p>
<p>A basic Service Wrap is illustrated in <strong>Figure 9-6</strong>.</p>
<p>Service Management Wrapper</p>

</code></pre><p>250 Service Agility</p>
<p>The Service Wrap is based on the following key elements:</p>
<p><strong>○ Service Management Wrapper</strong> - The fundamental processes that
manage the service using an appropriate supporting toolchain,
initially implementing the MVS and growing as required. The
Managed Service Wrapper is based on a set of appropriate
processes implemented by qualified Service Delivery Managers,
Service Support and Process Analysts, and specialist teams</p>
<p><strong>○ Platform</strong> - The Service Wrap must manage the underlying
infrastructure of the Product. This may be physical ‘tin’ on premises
or in data centres, or Cloud-based infrastructure. Platform
Engineering specialists will be required to deliver the Service Wrap.
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) components may all be relevant
depending on the Product</p>
<p><strong>○ Application Support and Maintenance</strong> - By definition, an IT service
is delivered by an existing application stack. Often the technology
is dated, and technologists will lose interest when supporting
it, leading to staff retention issues. This application will require
support, together with any required changes and new product
implementations. The Service Wrap should ensure that the Product
can deliver value to the business. Incidents will arise, issues will
be identified, and improvements will be required, all of which
may impact the value earned. Incident and problem management
processes are required, supported by resources to resolve any
application issues that arise. It’s worth considering the backlog
of technical debt alongside user-driven support and maintenance
items. Constant tactical solutions and ‘quick fixes’ may introduce
technical debt and erode quality if not managed carefully</p>
<p>Service Agility 251</p>
<p><strong>○ New Business Services</strong> - The Service Wrap isn’t just about
keeping the infrastructure and application lights on. Product
delivery doesn’t stop with the MVP. Each Product Increment will
transform the service in some way, and this must be supported by
an appropriate change management approach. Some change will
modify existing services, whilst others will introduce Service Wraps
of their own. This area is often where new technology is introduced,
providing challenges for staff.</p>
<p>Each aspect of the Service Wrap has Continuous Improvement at its
core. Regular Service Wrap retrospectives will help identify gaps and
areas for improvement, creating new backlog items to enhance and
improve the MVS.</p>
<p>There is much more to the Service Wrap than process and tooling
alone. As with any Agile transformation, there is a Culture and Values
dimension. Having the right people, with the right skills and the right
mindset, is fundamental.</p>
<p>252 Service Agility</p>
<h3 id="establishing-the-service-wrap">Establishing the Service Wrap</h3>
<p>The Enterprise Agile method provides a repeatable pattern for
delivery that can be specialised to help navigate the creation and
implementation of the Service Wrap by treating it as a Product like
any other.</p>
<p>The specialised pattern is defined in <strong>Figure 9-7</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 9-7: MVS Delivery Pattern</strong></p>

</code></pre><pre><code>Rapid
Take-<span class="hljs-keyword">on</span>
</code></pre><pre><code><span class="hljs-attribute">Delivery</span>
</code></pre><p>Each step should deliver value to the business:</p>
<p><strong>Maturity Assessment</strong></p>
<p>Take stock of your organisation’s maturity to run the service. Undertake
a ‘state of the nation’ review to understand what is currently in place,
what works, what doesn’t, and where the pain points are.</p>
<p>Service Agility 253</p>
<p><strong>Service Design</strong></p>
<p>Formulate a process backlog for the target service to address the gaps
identified by the maturity assessment. Prioritise the backlog into an MVS
view, identify any quick wins and establish a plan for delivering the MVS.
Identify and address key Delivery risks and prioritise to achieve the ‘No
surprises endgame.’</p>
<p><strong>Rapid Take-On</strong></p>
<p>Implement the plan to deliver the MVS, including any knowledge transfer
required and establishing any tooling. Refine the process backlog as you
progress and capture lessons learned during the Delivery.</p>
<p>This is not an academic or box-ticking exercise. Each Service Wrap
will have characteristics unique to the organisation. Identify the target
Service Wrap, understand the appropriate MVS for the product and
organisation, and then apply the pattern to implement it. Consider the
Service Wrap from the outset of product delivery, and work toward the
MVS in readiness for launching the MVP.</p>
<p>Don’t try to ‘boil the ocean’. Assess what is currently in place,
understand the key areas of risk, and build a plan to address them with
the MVS. Continue to review the service’s product backlog and build
Continuous Improvement into the way of working right from the start.</p>
<p>254 Service Agility</p>

<h1 id="to-agility">to Agility</h1>
<p>256 The Journeyto Agility</p>
<p>Following the first release of this book, we were often asked to
talk to organisations about what Agile is, and what benefits it
brings. More recently, we have been approached for advice on
how to adopt it, or how to recover a failing adoption.</p>
<p>The key to success with Agile is understanding that it is not an
end in itself, but rather it is a journey and a way of being. This
may sound a little hippyish, but it is a key point - achieving
greater organisational Agility can only come by adjusting thinking
and embedding this into the culture.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we explore some of the lessons learned from
working with organisations on their journey – what works, and
what does not. It should be recognised that this is a long-term
commitment and that benefits will not be realised overnight.</p>
<p>We strongly believe in a heavy dose of pragmatism around Agility</p>
<ul>
<li>try things, fail fast and do not slavishly follow new ways of
working that are not right for your organisation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2>
<h3 id="the-rise-of-the-commercial-agile-framework">The Rise of the Commercial Agile Framework</h3>
<p>Recent years have seen the emergence of several Agile frameworks, all
describing an approach that supports the adoption of Agile at scale:</p>
<p><strong>○ Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS)</strong> – Scaling of the familiar Scrum approach
to Agile, developed in 2005</p>
<p><strong>○ The Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)</strong> – Developed in 2011</p>
<p>The Journeyto Agility 257</p>
<p><strong>○ Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD)</strong> – From the 2012 book</p>
<p><strong>○ The ‘Spotify Model’</strong> – A description of Spotify’s operating model
from October 2012 that is frequently misinterpreted as a template
for an Agile organisation</p>
<p><strong>○ Nexus</strong> – Created in 2015 by Ken Schwaber, one of the co-creators
of Scrum</p>
<p><strong>○ Scrum at Scale</strong> – Developed by Jeff Sutherland (co-creator of
Scrum) in collaboration with Alex Brown.</p>
<p>These frameworks have been influenced by experiences of delivering
Agile within large organisations. They share common influences (Lean,
Product Thinking, Scrum) and include some good practices and ideas.</p>
<p>Large scale organisations, envious of the pace of change that smaller
start-up rivals achieve, often see the adoption of a commercial
large scale Agile framework as a shortcut to increased Agility. These
frameworks offer the comforting option to ‘buy in’ accreditation,
a shared language for a big corporate, and what appears to be a
process-driven approach to implementation and delivery. In this
chapter, we explore the risks associated with the notion that one
can implement ‘Agile in a box’.</p>
<h3 id="change-management">Change Management</h3>
<p>Anyone who has been involved in a significant business change initiative
will recognise the difficulties in making process and cultural changes.</p>
<p>Embracing Agile within an organisation is no different:</p>
<p><strong>○ People are naturally resistant to having change imposed upon them</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Initiatives introduced without buy-in from the people who are
engaged in the change are far less likely to be successful</li>
</ul>
<p>258 The Journeyto Agility</p>
<p><strong>○ The effects of change can’t be predicted</strong> - What works in one
organisation is a poor indicator of what will work in another, which
will be an entirely different collection of individuals, processes
and environments.</p>
<p>Delivering change on the scale of Agile adoption requires a groundswell
of support spanning the organisation at all levels, from the senior
leadership outwards.</p>
<h2 id="bjss-opinion">BJSS Opinion</h2>
<h3 id="holistic-adoption">Holistic Adoption</h3>
<p>To be successful, Agile adoption must be holistic. It cannot be
considered only as a feature of the system development lifecycle (SDLC)
in the IT department. While a partial transition can add value, making
Agile delivery work well impacts all aspects of the organisation.</p>
<p>Where this holistic approach is not taken, we have seen many
anti-patterns, including ‘Developer-only’ Agile, where Waterfall
requirements are ‘delivered’ using development Sprints, or Sprint-based
release candidates only being released on a twice-yearly basis, reducing
the benefits delivered in a holistic adoption.</p>
<h3 id="one-size-does-not-fit-all">One Size Does Not Fit All</h3>
<p>Agile is not an end in itself, and not a desirable state of being in its
own right. Agile practices, as we’ve seen, are helpful in accelerating
innovation, reducing risk and improving delivery success. However, these
outcomes can be achieved with a variety of very different practices,
which all sit under the umbrella of Agile values and the principles
described in the Agile Manifesto.</p>
<p>The Journeyto Agility 259</p>
<p>In practice, we have seen that aspiring to adopt a particular, fixed form
of Agile is significantly more likely to fail when the characteristics of
the organisation are not taken into account. Organisations should guard
against engaging professional Agile coaches who attempt to impose a
particular Agile variant that is not appropriate for the situation.</p>
<p>Large scale adoptions of commercial, off-the-shelf frameworks (LeSS,
SAFE, DAD etc.) often fall foul of this approach. They attempt to
proceduralise Agile practices into a universally applicable approach
that doesn’t recognise the cultural and structural complexities of
real organisations.</p>
<h3 id="agile-transformational-models">Agile Transformational Models</h3>
<p>We have seen several patterns in organisations attempting to foster Agile
working practices:</p>
<p><strong>‘Big Bang’</strong></p>
<p>The whole organisation makes a single, coordinated ‘step change’ to
Agile – typically using a commercial framework as a base. As a result,
the organisation will often be forced to be prescriptive in the application
of Agile, effectively swapping one process-driven framework for another,
and failing to embrace real Agility.</p>
<p><strong>The Incubation Model</strong></p>
<p>An extreme approach, in which a new, independent department is spun
up, typically in a new creative environment, unconstrained by many of
the ‘old rules’. This approach engenders resentment and conflict from
the ‘old world’, followed quickly by significant attrition.</p>
<p>260 The Journeyto Agility</p>
<p><strong>Changing Key Positions</strong></p>
<p>In this model, senior personnel are replaced, typically by external hires
or consultants who bring in new ways of working. Cultural resistance
from the ‘old guard’ is the predictable consequence.</p>
<p>We advocate a more adaptive, incremental approach to Agile transition:</p>
<p><strong>○ Start small, deliver early and embrace a tight feedback loop</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Track progress and publicise success</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Fail fast and adapt less successful efforts</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Identify and specifically target any organisational blockers</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Encourage and guide rather than control and define.</strong></p>
<p>We explore these ideas further later in this chapter.</p>

<h3 id="a-culture-of-innovation-and-continuous-improvement">A Culture of Innovation and Continuous Improvement</h3>
<p>Teams will only embark on the transition to a more Agile mindset if the
culture and values of the organisation support it.</p>
<p>Rather than coming from the top of the organisation, innovation
frequently occurs in teams empowered to improve the way they
work with the space to innovate and the freedom to make
occasional mistakes.</p>
<p>This also means being Agile with organisational structures. Often, a team
starting to adopt Agile processes highlights the problem that supporting
or dependent teams are not Agile, hindering the delivery process.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to recognise that the working environment plays a
key part in working culture. Teams need space to collaborate, create and
step out of their normal ways of working.</p>
<p>The Journeyto Agility 263</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean you need table football and bean bags, but you
should consider changing the focus from ‘sit down’ meeting rooms to
Stand-up areas, providing whiteboards and collaborative team spaces.</p>
<h3 id="use-appropriate-funding-and-commercial-models">Use Appropriate Funding and Commercial Models</h3>
<p>Funding cycles can have a major impact on the ability of the organisation
to deliver value.</p>
<p>An Agile IT and business function steered by a Waterfall governance
cycle becomes an iterative rather than truly Agile organisation. The
delivery organisation iterates towards an unchanging goal, and the true
benefits of Agile are lost.</p>
<p>To gain the benefits of true Agility, organisations must adopt smaller,
Leaner funding cycles, with initiative objectives set more as outcomes
rather than presupposing fixed deliverables, months or even years ahead
of time.</p>
<p>Funding and procurement strategies will also have an impact on the
behaviour of suppliers. People generally want to do the right thing as an
employee. The same is true of most suppliers. In our experience, while
suppliers want to make a profit, they also care about doing a good job
because they’re proud of it.</p>
<p>An organisation will likely want to ensure it gets good value from its
suppliers. Various mechanisms exist to incentivise suppliers to deliver
and behave in the right way. The substantive point is that incentives are
used to drive behaviours - make sure you pick the right incentives such
that they align with your organisation’s goals. We have seen examples
where this has gone awry. In one situation, a software partner was
measured by the number of lines of code it delivered!</p>
<p>264 The Journeyto Agility</p>
<h2 id="the-enterprise-agile-approach">The Enterprise Agile Approach</h2>
<h3 id="adopting-agility-within-the-organisation">Adopting Agility within the Organisation</h3>
<p>Greater Agility is not achieved solely through training courses and
implementing a new target operating model. Some organisations attempt
a ‘sheep dip’ conversion process only for their people to arrive back in
the office following the training course wondering where to begin.
A ‘big-bang’ transformation of the entire organisation is unlikely to
be successful.</p>
<p>The only time we advocate starting with a fully Agile model in mind is a
greenfield scenario, for example, when bringing a previously outsourced
service in-house, or launching a brand-new product. For most
organisations, a fundamental cultural shift is required, which is typically
only achieved through a concerted effort and with commitment from
motivated, sponsored and engaged people.</p>
<p>We recommend taking an Agile approach to becoming more Agile:</p>
<p><strong>1. Plan the Agile journey in the same way as we have described for</strong>
    **product delivery</p>
<ol>
<li>Outline a set of goals for the organisation, develop a roadmap<strong>
 </strong>and then progressively move towards achieving these goals<strong>
 </strong>incrementally using a Sprint pattern</li>
<li>Measure success against outcomes, be realistic about where you<strong>
 </strong>have failed and adapt accordingly.<strong> View failure as a useful output
 of the process and react to it positively
</strong>4. Be mindful of toolset and terminology, but don’t obsess over them.**
 Project collaboration toolsets, continuous delivery infrastructure
 and communication channels are helpful, but in themselves do not
 make the organisation Agile.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Journeyto Agility 265</p>
<p>A suggested journey to Agility may look something like that shown in
<strong>Figure 10-1</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 10-1: Suggested Journey to Agility</strong></p>

</code></pre><p>266 The Journeyto Agility</p>
<p><strong>○ Ensure you have sufficient sponsorship to be successful – often
the CEO or CDO</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Identify drivers for change and articulate them as
organisational goals</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Create a roadmap for key initiatives and desired value</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Find an owner to lead the change and ambassadors to
support them</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Develop the core processes and tools to support the transition</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Implement across a small number of exemplar products</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Constantly review and refine the approach using feedback for
each increment</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Adjust the roadmap based on lessons learned from early adopters</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Broaden the scope to further products across the organisation</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Encourage knowledge sharing between teams and
publish successes.</strong></p>
<p>In summary, there isn’t a ‘project’ to become Agile. Identify goals,
produce a roadmap and provide support to teams to help them achieve
those goals. The journey to Agile requires ongoing support, not just
formal training - identify individuals able to coach teams and help them
to develop their skills.</p>
<h3 id="monitor-maturity">Monitor Maturity</h3>
<p>Useful tools to identify the progress being made on the Agile journey are
those that track change or progress over time. We’ve seen some success
through the use of carefully worded surveys, which are sufficiently
lightweight to be repeated at regular intervals.</p>
<p>A more detailed approach involves the use of Maturity Models. These
can be used to give a measurable demonstration of progress but must</p>
<p>The Journeyto Agility 267</p>
<p>be carefully designed around ‘outcomes’ rather than to test conformity
to a set of expected practices.</p>
<p>For example, the team should be assessed against a holistic measure
of whether or not they achieved an objective, rather than simply if they
implemented the required Scrum processes. Agile is a mechanism to
help the team define, manage and work towards those objectives.</p>
<p>From a process perspective, there is value in assessing against the
expectations you define whilst running Scrum - e.g., does the team
regularly define proper objectives for a Sprint and meet them? This
is an indication of their capability maturity and will help direct
further support.</p>
<p>The key difference is that the team should be judged on whether they
met their objectives. Any measurement of how they met their objectives
is purely for assisting in their development and not for judgement.</p>
<p>When assessing an organisation against a Maturity Model, expect
different Product Teams to be at different levels of maturity. Each team
and product is different and their rate of progression will differ, often
due to real-world constraints. A Maturity Model can help highlight which
teams need additional coaching or support. Re-running the Maturity
Model as a lightweight health check can demonstrate progress towards
the company objectives.</p>
<p>The Maturity Model should also include the capabilities of the
organisation. For example, a successful Agile Product Team will have
a bias towards some skillsets over others compared with traditional
delivery - for example, automation testers over manual, ‘infrastructure
as code’ DevOps engineers over traditional infrastructure engineers.</p>
<p>Keep the model simple and supportive. Detailed audits are likely to
create concern and are not necessary for an ability-led organisation
where experienced Agile leaders work with Product Teams.</p>
<p>268 The Journeyto Agility</p>
<p>A typical Agile Maturity Model might include:</p>
<p><strong>○ A series of assessments aligned to the different aspects of Agile
product delivery (define, develop, assure, deploy, operate)</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ A basic rating mechanism that identifies maturity against
each category</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ A method of positioning the different aspects of the team’s work
on a maturity scale</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ A set of prioritised recommendations to take the team to the next
stage of maturity.</strong></p>
<p>An example of a maturity assessment for a Technical Delivery Team is
illustrated in <strong>Figure 10-2</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="foster-supplier-collaboration">Foster Supplier Collaboration</h3>
<p>A key aspect of achieving more rapid change and Agility is to ensure
that all barriers are removed. No operational silos should exist and all
contributing parties should be aligned with the same goal.</p>
<p>This is often why the organisations spearheading Agility are technology
start-ups. They are not constrained by legacy systems and processes
and have the brand (and finances) to attract and retain the skilled
people they need.</p>
<p>Most organisations do not retain all of the skills they need in-house and
augment their numbers and capability by engaging external suppliers.
Getting this relationship right requires effort. Long-term partnerships
undoubtedly achieve more than a revolving door of different suppliers.
The closer you get to making suppliers an extension of your organisation
and motivated around common goals, the more likely you are to achieve
results. This suggests a more collaborative approach than traditional
procurement-driven relationships.</p>
<h3 id="funding-for-success">Funding for Success</h3>
<p>Many factors play into the funding arrangements – either for internal
teams, or external delivery partners. The organisation will naturally
seek to incentivise all teams around its goals, but such outcome-based
arrangements can be hard to broker.</p>
<p>Four elements require measurement and control:</p>
<p><strong>○ Delivery</strong> – Have the required outputs been produced?</p>
<p><strong>○ Quality</strong> – Are the outputs delivered to the required standard?</p>
<p><strong>○ Collaboration</strong> – Has the team worked collaboratively with other
parts of the organisation?</p>
<p>270 The Journeyto Agility</p>
<p><strong>○ Cost</strong> – Have all objectives been met cost-effectively?</p>
<p>When working with external suppliers, the client organisation needs
everyone to cooperate to deliver services to the appropriate quality
standard. Several models can be used to drive the required behaviours
and achieve the results. These exist on a spectrum from Time and
Materials to Fixed Price.</p>
<p>All models have pros and cons, as outlined in <strong>Table 10-2</strong>.</p>

<p>No model is perfect for both parties. In our view, the best outcome is
achieved when penalties and incentives are fair, balanced and based on
straightforward performance measures.</p>
<p>Ideally, client and supplier will consider supplier contribution as an
ongoing activity without constant reference to a contract. The more the
vendor and supplier trust each other, the more value each will get from
the relationship.</p>

<ol>
<li>Adopting Agile is not just about changing
 your SDLC, it often requires a holistic cultural
 shift within the organisation.</li>
<li>Avoid trying to move the whole organisation
 in one go. Focus on successes in smaller areas
 and build on these.</li>
<li>Be wary of ‘Agile in a box’ approaches
 and avoid obsessing about Agile as an end
 in itself.</li>
<li>Recognise that a lightweight audit process
 and Maturity Model can be invaluable
 to assess where you can improve the
 effectiveness of your ways of working and
 measuring progress.</li>
<li>When contracting suppliers, be sure to
 align any incentives and penalties with
 organisational and product delivery goals.</li>

<h1 id="enterprise-data">Enterprise Data</h1>
<p>274 Enterprise Data</p>
<p>Previous iterations of this book have focused on the application
of Enterprise Agile to the delivery of software projects. In this
new chapter, we look at how to apply some of the principles
and values of Enterprise Agile to the delivery of data projects</p>
<ul>
<li>a rapidly increasing proportion of the work we undertake
with clients.</li>
</ul>
<p>Agile is a word not commonly associated with the pace at which
data projects move. They are well known for delivering slowly,
being heavily IT-driven and lacking necessary levels of interaction
with the rest of the business. Despite the way software delivery
has progressed, it is only very recently that we are seeing the
market start to adopt a more Agile culture and approach to data
deliveries. There has been, and still is in many cases, a lack of
value-driven thinking and results. It’s reductive to assume that
data itself is what brings value. Instead, it’s how we use the data.</p>
<p>Data is a load bearing pillar of digital transformation, providing
the information on which to make quick and effective business
decisions, the foundations for automation and AI. It is critical
that organisations are able to move quickly, responding to a
fast-changing world and customer base. Unfortunately,
technologies that underpin the delivery of value in data-driven
projects have, until recently, reinforced ‘big bang’ IT delivery.
Fortunately, those underpinning technologies are changing, as
are approaches to data delivery - DataOps and MLOps are
growing in their adoption.</p>
<p>This chapter details our recommended value-oriented approach
to delivering results with data: nail it, then scale it. We
suggest how you can implement a DataOps culture to deliver
the technology that supports these results. By using these
approaches, you can deliver the data you need, when you need it,
in the way that you need – and then exploit it as you need it.</p>

<h3 id="data-lake-data-lakehouse-data-mesh-data-fabric">Data Lake, Data Lakehouse, Data Mesh, Data Fabric</h3>
<p>Some of the most popular and talked about architectural patterns for
large scale and varied data today are architectures designed and evolved
within the era of ‘big data’.</p>
<p>The <strong>data lake</strong> was an early big data paradigm, a place to store data
of many different types, allowing for the exploitation of unstructured,
semi-structured and structured data, at scale, in a distributed manner.
This architecture and the software that enabled it were a step change
in capability and the foundation of today’s data platforms. At the same
time, the key technology was one of the primary reasons that projects
saw such huge failure rates (one Gartner analyst claimed in 2017 that
85% of big data projects failed). While it may have started a data
revolution, the technology was difficult to use effectively, with several
cons that were often ignored or papered over in the rush to be big
data driven.</p>
<p>Data technology and architecture has evolved quickly since then, as
has our collective experience. As part of this evolution, and to resolve
some of the downsides of the data lake paradigm, the data lake has
developed into the <strong>data lakehouse</strong> , a combination of data lake and
data warehouse. With many organisations feeding a downstream data
warehouse with data in their lake, the lakehouse merges these popular
yet quite different data architectures into one. The result is designed to
maintain many of the benefits of each while avoiding some of the painful
downsides experienced in separation. It aims to bridge the structured
and curated natured of a warehouse with the less structured nature of a
lake. This results in accelerated availability of data through a reduction
in the data engineering required, as well as data that can be optimised
on the fly for uses such as query, visualisation and analytics.</p>
<p>276 Enterprise Data</p>
<p>More recent still is the <strong>data mesh</strong> paradigm, mirroring a question
experienced throughout IT - centralisation vs decentralisation. Where
modern data architectures have attempted to centralise data, reducing
silos through ingestion and management of data in a single enterprise
data platform, data mesh looks to decentralise data ownership and
management, with distributed data domains managed like data
“products” with common self-serve components of data infrastructure
provided as-a-platform to those managing domain data sets. This
product-based approach to data is growing in popularity, and roles like
Data Product Manager are starting to reach the mainstream.</p>
<p>Finally, the <strong>data fabric</strong> , one of Gartner’s Top Strategic Technology
trends for 2022. Whereas the other concepts covered in this section are
architectures, data fabric is more conceptual. The “fabric” is a layer of
data and information of all different forms (video, audio, text, structured
tables, graphs, etc.), often using multiple technologies and architectural
patterns for storage, processing and retrieval (e.g., a graph database, a
search index, a data lake, and a relational database). Automation and
machine learning are a part of the fabric itself – for example, extraction
of structured entities and features from free text into a knowledge
graph, or extraction of information from image and videos. This is clearly
a very powerful concept; however, in our opinion, knowledge graphs
would be a big step for many organisations currently struggling to
develop approaches to basic data management.</p>
<h3 id="data-science">Data Science</h3>
<p>There is a lot of misinterpretation around data science; many assume it
includes business intelligence (BI) or the descriptive analysis of data that
analysts have been doing for many years.</p>
<p>Data science is a different discipline. It applies scientific methods and
tools to extract knowledge from data. It focuses primarily on the upper
end of the analytics spectrum – predictive or prescriptive analytics via</p>
<p>Enterprise Data 277</p>
<p>machine learning – to predict what will happen and what action can be
taken to make something happen.</p>
<p>Simply put, if data analytics seeks to understand data, data science
seeks to make predictions with it.</p>
<p>Data scientists need to have skills in engineering, statistical modelling
and business analysis – a hard combination to find. Therefore, the
increased demand for data science and machine learning is rarely
complemented by an increased understanding of data science and
analytics. As a result, Data Science Teams are often formed without an
appropriate level of business analysis, feasibility or design.</p>
<p>Many businesses struggle to set measurable goals for data science or
machine learning initiatives. To overcome this, business functions and
Data Science Teams must collaborate to meet customer requirements
and create a supported and maintainable solution.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of the field, it’s not unusual for data science to end
up as a constant cycle of experiments. But data science should be so
much more than experimental. Businesses need to get beyond this cycle
and start generating real value from data science across the enterprise.
We’ll explore how to achieve this by conducting Agile data science in an
enterprise context.</p>
<h3 id="dataops-and-mlops">DataOps and MLOps</h3>
<p>As mentioned, Agile is often not associated with data projects. The same
could also be said about engineering and operational rigour.</p>
<p>DevOps has become the default mode for software delivery. A similar
approach can be applied to data and machine learning. DataOps and
MLOps are the data and machine learning versions of DevOps and they
apply to the entire data and machine learning lifecycle.</p>

<p>Of course, development is not where data ends. It needs a great deal of
operational care - the understanding of which you should not leave to
the end or to an Operations Team alone. Operation of a data platform
and the data within requires a different set of skills and roles to other
software deliveries, as well as strong technical knowledge of the tools
and capabilities that comprise a modern data platform.</p>
<p>We introduced the concept of DataOps earlier – DevOps for data. In our
opinion, the principles of Agile and DevOps can be applied successfully
to data, hence this new chapter. It does, however, require a level of
expertise and experience that many organisations may still not have
access to today, and a skills gap remains.</p>
<h3 id="centralisation-vs-decentralisation">Centralisation vs Decentralisation</h3>
<p>An important set of questions that appear throughout the
implementation of IT, and no less in data, are: Should I centralise or
decentralise? Is there a balance to be struck? Where is it? The big data
movement came with the promise of the data lake, a central location for
all your analytical data and the answer to those fragmented data silos
many enterprises experienced. However, silos are hard to wrestle away
from their owners, especially when the new promised land is outside of
their control. Many have learned this on their journey.</p>
<p>In the concepts section of this chapter, we briefly introduced the data
mesh paradigm, one which favours decentralisation over the centralised
approach in the ascendancy today. In the last year or two, data mesh
has received some interest, though adoption is currently low and there
are few referenceable examples of enterprise adoption. With many
organisations feeling the pain of implementing data programmes and the
often-quoted stats for data project failure rates (although many of these
are outdated now), an alternative approach is appealing. However, we
find it hard to recommend the adoption of data mesh at time of writing.
With limited real-world examples and a lack of best practice advice,
we feel that a watching brief is the best recommendation. Instead of</p>
<p>Enterprise Data 281</p>
<p>looking at wholesale paradigm shifts, organisations should focus on
decentralising their approach to data exploitation while maintaining
centralised enterprise data platforms.</p>
<p>While maintaining a central data platform as a shared business service
is recommended, relying only on a central team to derive intelligence
from data is not. Teams across the enterprise must be able to build and
deploy their own machine learning, build their own dashboards, fuse
their own data sources, and interpret their own data. A single Analytics
Team is not Agile when scaling across an enterprise organisation;
instead, it introduces a major bottleneck.</p>
<p>To enable Agile data-driven business at scale, exploitation of data
should be decentralised through self-service capabilities in combination
with fusion teams. These teams should have the skills necessary to take
advantage of data quickly and effectively, as well as the understanding
of the business problems faced. To ensure these teams don’t eschew
standards, security, privacy and all the other good things, they should
be supported with patterns, good practice and time from experts</p>

<h2 id="the-enterprise-agile-approach">The Enterprise Agile Approach</h2>
<h3 id="align-it-and-the-business">Align IT and the Business</h3>
<p>One of the key issues in the delivery of IT has always been its alignment
with the wider business. The same is true for data, yet its alignment
is even further behind that of software delivery. As a result, we’re
starting to see patterns emerge where data programmes are treated like
software programmes.</p>
<p>This misalignment used to be, at least in part, due to the complexity
of the technology and a lack of skills. IT departments didn’t want the
business seeing or being involved in projects because they were scared
they’d be found out. This led to more failure because, even if the
technology worked, it was invariably late and not designed for users, so
the business didn’t want to use it.</p>
<p>This led to shadow IT, people working around data lakes, more data silos
and a lot of wasted investment. Today, the profession has become better
at aligning IT with the business and its users but we still see many
enterprises getting it wrong.</p>
<h3 id="focusing-on-value">Focusing on Value</h3>
<p>Organisations invest time and attention in data because they want to
generate value from it. The great potential benefit to the organisation
often prompts teams to embark on large, slow initiatives aimed
at producing perfect results. It’s not unusual to see data platform
deliveries go over a year without ever being made available to a user.
This is a dangerous and unnecessary approach. You won’t know how
users will react to what you are building or learn from how they use it.</p>
<p>Enterprise Data 283</p>
<p>You also restrict your ability to generate immediate value in the business
and force users to find alternative routes to their goals.</p>
<p>This is not to say that teams should abandon their professional
standards and resort to quick and dirty solutions. Quicker and more
frequent delivery can be balanced with data management rigour and
effective, user-relevant data modelling. Access to data can be provided
with incremental management, similar to incremental development of
system features, thereby enabling the onboarding of users as early
as possible.</p>
<p>There is often a tendency to delay or even block delivery of data science
use cases until all the data has been fully managed into a data platform.
In some use cases, this is a valid approach; for example, those which are
sensitive to privacy concerns or require data sources with particularly
poor quality. But there are often a wide range of use cases that can
progress successfully and return great value and learning to your
business without waiting for completion of the platform.</p>
<p>We believe you can and should support the undertaking of analytical
projects outside of an in-development platform or managed data
initiative where timelines and backlogs will not effectively align. This is
especially important in the early stages of your data journey. The idea
that you need to spend many months getting data into a fit state before
you can reap the rewards of data science is a fallacy. Additionally, the
discovered needs of your analysts and data scientists will help to inform
the development of your data platform.</p>
<p>Focusing on delivering value in this way leads to a parallel approach to
data management, data platform and data exploitation. Our experiences
with this approach lead to a further recommendation: we suggest that
enterprise-wide data science platforms are only put in place once
several data science projects have been successfully implemented into
production. This allows time to learn how the Data Science Team works
best, what tools and technologies they see success with, and how you</p>
<p>284 Enterprise Data</p>
<p>can best support them with platform components that improve their
effectiveness. We call this approach <strong>nail it, then scale it</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="thinking-holistically">Thinking Holistically</h3>
<p>A successful data programme considers data holistically. The scope
encompasses considering a technology platform for managing the
data, the processes for managing and governing the data, information
and cyber security, data valuation and condition, analytics, BI and
visualisation. Critically, it also includes how you exploit the data to
support your business strategy.</p>
<p>Unsuccessful data programmes can fail on any or all of these factors.
Widely discussed reasons for failure include complicated technology,
unrealistic expectations, lack of communication between IT and
business, and skills gaps. We would also add operational complexity to
this list.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we believe that it is key to success that data is
delivered as a service to the business. It’s not simply an IT project,
which is how many data programmes are approached today. Rather, it’s
the combination of all these things wrapped in a set of services that are
offered to those that use or interact with data within a business.</p>
<p>We call this data as a business service and have introduced service
design into our data deliveries to help organisations implement data
effectively. When you look at data through the lens of providing a service
to the business, you can start to ask:</p>
<p><strong>○ What questions are people in the business trying to answer?
And why?</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ What kind, quality, volume and frequency of data might people
need to help them answer these questions?</strong></p>
<p>Enterprise Data 285</p>
<p><strong>○ How will people turn data into information – that is, what context
do they need around the data and how will this be provided
and understood?</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ How will people turn this information into action? How will it
improve outcomes and impact?</strong></p>
<p>The key word in each of these questions is ‘people’. If you’re in the
position of starting a data project from scratch, don’t start with the
technology, start with – and speak to – people. Ask questions, frame the
problems you’re trying to solve and capture user needs before exploring
how to solve them.</p>
<p>Assuming a data platform is part of your solution, it’s equally important
to keep a human-centred, service-oriented lens on how you design,
build, launch and operate it. This means you can ask questions such as:</p>
<p><strong>○ How will people get data into the platform?</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ How will people discover, access and use data in the platform?</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ What kind of support will people need?</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ How will the existence and value of the platform be communicated
to people?</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Who will run and maintain the platform, and how?</strong></p>
<p>A tool we use to help answer these questions is the service blueprint.
This captures the end-to-end user journeys of people interacting with
the platform, expresses their user needs at each significant step, and
maps out holistically what should be in place to meet those needs from
the perspectives of people, technology, process, policy and partnerships.</p>
<p>When used as part of an Agile delivery, a service blueprint can act
as a living document and focal point for keeping a human-centred
perspective on what the team is building. It can evolve and flex as you
continue to learn from users and the business, and help you respond to</p>
<p>286 Enterprise Data</p>
<p>pivots along the way by highlighting gaps or new areas that might need
to be addressed to ensure successful delivery.</p>
<p>Finally, when building a data platform, it can be tempting to try and
boil the ocean, especially if you’ve done your user research and have
identified lots of needs to cater to. We recommend a more measured
approach. Aim to deliver value throughout, prioritise your backlog and
consider your business objectives as well as the needs of your users. A
helpful tool for this is a strategic roadmap. This allows you to plot out
themed user needs, business goals and alignment with other initiatives
so that you can plan your effort and budgets accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="delivering-a-steel-thread">Delivering a Steel Thread</h3>
<p>Many enterprise data programmes take a long time to start delivering
value to the business, with a linear dependency between data platform
delivery and exploitation of data for business value. This echoes the
traditional, Waterfall approach to systems delivery which is being
superseded by Agile approaches. However, just as functionality can be
made redundant by changes in the environment, so data value is often
dependent on timing. If value from data isn’t delivered to the business
when it can be exploited, opportunities are lost and the vision for data
is tarnished. Interest in continued funding can quickly wane when return
on investment is not forthcoming.</p>
<p>We have seen great success in delivering data programmes – including
platform, data management, service design and data exploitation –
through the adoption of steel threading. The steel thread is a software
engineering concept that’s popular in Agile development approaches. A
system’s main functionality is like a thread that runs through the system.
Since all the other functionality is based on this thread, it needs to be
very robust and reliable – as strong as steel. In the data programme
context, we can define a steel thread of functionality, data, service and
value running end-to-end, and deliver this into production first. Using
this approach, you build some of the core aspects of the technology</p>
<p>Enterprise Data 287</p>

generates business value and thereby create a platform upon which
to deliver further use cases iteratively, each time building out parts of
another thread.</p>
<p>Agile principles are often not applied to the delivery of data platforms,
aside from certain aspects of the Agile operating rhythm. We advocate
taking more learnings from Agile and the wider field of software delivery
into data delivery – the section on DataOps below goes into further
detail on this.</p>
<p>288 Enterprise Data</p>
<h3 id="using-the-right-technology">Using the Right Technology</h3>
<p>Technology in the big data space has been genuinely difficult for
years. The invention of Hadoop was a turning point for data in the
enterprise, but it was also a huge peak in complexity – one that
many significantly underestimated.</p>
<p>Big data technologies can be hard to integrate, understand, deliver and
operate. Implementing technology in this space has required specialist
engineering skills and the skills gap has been significant. This has led
to many organisations asking technical staff to learn as they go, adding
uncertainty to the delivery timeline and risk to the initiative.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 11-3: Hadoop Complexity</strong></p>

</code></pre><p>Enterprise Data 289</p>
<p>Ideally, organisations want to learn on small, low-risk projects. But
in this case, much of the learning has been undertaken on expensive
programmes and platforms that are potentially critical to business
success. Clearly, this represents a huge risk and has had a large part to
play in the failure of enterprise data strategy.</p>
<p>Recently, however, there has been a significant reduction in complexity
through platform-as-a-service and serverless data services offered
by the major public Cloud providers. These services are fully managed
by the Cloud provider, with resources often dynamically managed
and allocated, allowing the developer to focus on business logic
and functionality over servers and infrastructure. This can make the
technology part of the data equation significantly more straightforward.</p>
<p>The benefits of reduced complexity in data platforms cannot be
stressed enough. While there is huge potential for value in an enterprise
data platform, it is no use if you can’t easily build upon it or operate it
in production effectively – a trend we saw with on-premise Hadoop data
lakes. While there are well-known tales of hugely successful big data
solutions at organisations like Netflix and Uber, most enterprises do not
have the engineering capability or investment needed to handle such
highly complex software and data solutions. Nor, frankly, do they have
requirements that demand such complexity.</p>
<p>There are trade-offs to be made in the use of serverless data
capabilities. They often offer a reduced set of features or other
compromises such as performance reductions in certain circumstances.
Some organisations are wary of serverless data services because they
don’t support potential future requirements, one example being
effective monitoring and workflow of data pipelines in AWS’ serverless
data services.</p>
<p>However, for the price, you’ll get significantly reduced operational
complexity, reduced engineering complexity, faster delivery times, and
fewer bugs and operational issues. While decisions around technology
and Cloud services should be made on a case-by-case basis with</p>
<p>290 Enterprise Data</p>
<p>all considerations taken into account, we recommend weighting the
benefits of serverless data services very heavily. We would also go so
far as to recommend making any new data programme fully Cloud
native by default.</p>
<h3 id="implementing-a-dataops-culture">Implementing a DataOps Culture</h3>
<p><strong>Automation</strong></p>
<p>Automating data pipeline activity will increase velocity and repeatability,
helping to overcome one of the common issues with data platforms:
long lead times to onboard new data sources, resulting in unavailability
of data when users need it. Patternised ingest with full automation,
testing and monitoring will greatly simplify the task of ingestion. When
implemented successfully, this can reduce data ingest from weeks or
days to hours or minutes.</p>
<p>Automating testing, deployment and infrastructure will enable you to
implement continuous integration and continuous delivery for your
data platform. While this is similar to the approach taken in software
development, there are some interesting quirks that can make this
a challenge in data platforms – for example, automating testing and
deployment of code contained in notebook form.</p>
<p><strong>Security and Compliance</strong></p>
<p>Data residing in data lakes and warehouses can be of high value to
an attacker. We recommend that you implement security as early as
possible in your SDLC and ensure your Data Engineering Team is well
versed in common exploits and secure development approaches.</p>
<p>Enterprise Data 291</p>
<p>You should design the platform to be secure from the outset. Access
issues are more easily overcome when defining the security model than
when retrofitted to an existing model. Additionally, this allows your
team to run effective, incremental threat modelling sessions, identifying
security risk early and often. The outputs from this approach will aid
implementation of appropriate security controls.</p>
<p>Finally, use Cloud native capabilities to ensure regulatory compliance.
Develop blueprints, templates and compliance-as-code, which can
transform one-time InfoSec sign-off into continually monitored,
business-as-usual compliance. This provides an early warning system,
saving you from potential data breaches.</p>
<p><strong>Assurance</strong></p>
<p>Availability of test data is paramount. Without enough high-quality test
data, it is challenging to effectively test your pipelines, performance and
analytics, increasing the risk of unexpected issues when switching to
production workloads.</p>
<p>A testing strategy designed to work in production through isolation of
data is an excellent investment. This will enable you to run high quality
end-to-end testing with production data, significantly reducing the risk
of unexpected outcomes in live operation.</p>
<p>Peer review, paired working and collaborative sessions including security
and design should also be used to provide further quality assurance.</p>
<p><strong>Operational Monitoring</strong></p>
<p>Like DevOps, DataOps is as much about operating a data platform and
data flows as it is about developing them. Identification of metrics
required to operate the platform and KPIs required to operate the
business will allow you to set up operational monitoring, logging and</p>
<p>292 Enterprise Data</p>
<p>alerting early on. Information gained from trend analysis, combined with
feedback from users, can form further backlog stories for improvements.</p>
<h3 id="data-science-enterprise-agility">Data Science Enterprise Agility</h3>
<p>We touched on conducting data science when we discussed MLOps, but
data science doesn’t have to be death by a thousand experiments. Doing
lots of experiments isn’t Agile. In fact, it’s often wasteful. Extend your
thinking beyond experimentation and look to how data science can make
a sustainable difference to the business. Experimental phases should be
regarded as preparatory to more widespread change. Some organisations
ignore or forget their exploratory work when it is done and fund projects
with little promise.</p>
<p>Business Teams sometimes invest in data science projects without
considering the deployment and ongoing operational state of produced
applications. This means that teams of data scientists create proofs
of concept which need to be handed over to a traditional software
operations environment which is unprepared to receive and operate
them. A good way to avoid this divergence is to create hybrid Data
Science Development Teams – although this will clearly require
additional investment.</p>
<p>Machine learning originated as a research endeavour and the most
experienced people in the field come from that world. But as the
techniques of data science enter the mainstream, research culture
needs to adapt to or blend with the business delivery environment.
A practical way to do this is to balance research-led workloads with
value-led ones. The two approaches have equal validity; it’s not the case
that blue-sky experiments must always take second place to projects
considered more realistic in terms of current business goals. It can be
hard to understand the potential use cases of something entirely new,
such as graph databases. In such cases, well-designed experiments can
suggest new paths for development or terminate unpromising paths
before too much time or effort has been expended.</p>
<p>Enterprise Data 293</p>
<p>Effective data science models integrate with other software platforms
and are therefore subject to enterprise governance and controls as
other technologies evolve. It can be tempting to impose the same
management formalities as you would on software delivery. But data
science is characteristically distinct from traditional software delivery:</p>
<p><strong>○ Activities are harder to predict and plan (because they are
exploratory and research-driven)</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Instead of producing high-quality software with each iteration, the
objective is to evaluate hypotheses as quickly as possible</strong></p>
<p><strong>○ Early-stage data science focuses on the quality of the model rather
than its code.</strong></p>
<p>Enterprise Agile data science prioritises early demonstration of working
models alongside transparent and continuous sharing of results with
the customer. Data Science Teams in an Enterprise Agile environment
anticipate and address ambiguity and unknowns, using their close links
with the intended beneficiaries to clarify and refine rather than generate
multiple alternatives. They deliver models or model outputs frequently,
breaking delivery down into iterations and running live demonstrations
of each iteration with the sponsor for immediate detailed feedback.
They hold regular planning sessions to determine approaches or
enhancements. Weekly and even daily iterations are common.</p>
<p>The nature and speed of data science projects mean that formal written
documentation is often inappropriate due to the rapid pace of change
and the complexity of the underlying methods. It’s therefore better to
use face-to-face conversation as much as possible.</p>
<p>The problem spaces in data science are varied and the required business
expertise is often to be found at the edge of the organisation rather than
in the centre. For this reason, encourage co-operation between Subject
Matter Experts (SMEs) and the Data Science Delivery Team.</p>
<p>294 Enterprise Data</p>
<p>Teams should direct their own work and feel responsible for the
project and accountable for its success. Their attention should be
trained on reaching a minimum viable algorithm rather than exploring
every possible type of solution, catering for every variant of input or
addressing every potential use case in the domain.</p>
<p>Plan the work so that it can be delivered at a predictable pace.
Enterprise data science initiatives are likely to be accompanied by
expectations about releasing value within a budget and are therefore
subject to the same practical disciplines as other parts of the
organisation. Work in iterations and plan on delivering work within
allotted times so that delivery stays on track.</p>
<p>Although the primary aim in data science projects is to build great
models rather than craft exemplary code, there’s no doubt that good
software engineering habits contribute to solutions that are more
adaptable and usable as well as being more affordably integrated.
Clean code with minimal dependencies improves the delivery of models
intended to be iteratively enhanced. Data scientists from a purely
experimental background may not have been exposed to professional
software development practices. Helping them understand the benefits
of clean code – to their own practice as well as to the organisation as
a whole – will lead to greater productivity and satisfaction as well as
better quality software.</p>
<p>Domesticating and professionalising data science in the enterprise
setting ultimately means evolving a multi-disciplined capability that
embraces analytical engineering, requirements definition, architecture
and design work. The journey will include empirical retrospectives on the
process and experience to date with adjustment of the team’s methods
to maximise efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
<p>Enterprise Data 295</p>
<h2 id="key-points">Key Points</h2>
<ol>
<li>Align business and IT. Data is not an IT
 project or platform, it’s a service that the
 business consumes to generate value.</li>
<li>Drive out business value early and often, and
 don’t leave data science until after you’ve
 finished all the basics (they take a long time
 and there’s lots you can do in the meantime).</li>
<li>Data is not just an asset to be managed, it
 underpins business-critical services. It has
 many users and stakeholders. It needs to be
 governed, protected, analysed and all the
 rest. Think about data holistically and design
 around it for the needs of the business.</li>
<li>Get to value quickly while still building
 strategically. Build out your data platform,
 management and exploitation through steel
 threads of value.</li>
<li>Choose your data technologies carefully<ul>
<li>some can be cumbersome, complex and
unsuitable for quick iteration without a lot
of initial effort. Pick your technology well
and use the Cloud.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Embed a DataOps culture (similar to DevOps)
 into your data delivery, from automation to
 operational monitoring of machine
 learning models.</li>

<h2 id="appendix-a">Appendix A</h2>
<h3 id="engineering-successful-change">Engineering Successful Change</h3>
<p>We are often asked about the common pitfalls and lessons we have
learned from running the hundreds of projects that we have undertaken
over the last 30 years. In our experience the likelihood of enjoying a
‘No surprises endgame’ is dramatically improved by following these
golden rules:</p>
<p><strong>1. Use a Product Lifecycle to define a pattern to de-risk delivery.</strong>
    Use Feasibility, Discovery, and Delivery phases to provide a
    ‘ready, aim, fire’ approach
<strong>2. Implement structured and layered analysis to ensure that user</strong>
    **needs always relate back to a business outcome</p>
<ol>
<li>Account for all user needs and define non-functional requirements,<strong>
 </strong>including operational requirements during the Discovery phase</li>
<li>Employ routine Sprint events to plan, monitor, and control delivery.<strong>
 Always use Planning, Stand-up, Show and Tell, and Retrospective
 sessions. Never delay or cancel them
</strong>5. Only take stories into Sprints when they meet the Definition of<strong>
 </strong>Ready.<strong> Stories are only counted as complete when they meet the
 Definition of Done
</strong>6. Ensure Analysis, Development and Test are organised as cohesive<strong>
 </strong>activities working at the same rate towards common goals.<strong> Never
 allow these activities to become separated or any one of them to
 fall behind or out of sync with the others
</strong>7. Prove architecture early by using testing that can be automated<strong>
 </strong>and repeated continuously throughout delivery**</li>
</ol>
<p>298 Appendix A</p>
<p><strong>8. Build a fully automated delivery pipeline during Sprint 0 that</strong>
    <strong>includes tooling for development and deployment.</strong> If any part of
    the pipeline breaks, software production should stop until
    it is fixed. Never, for example, work around a failing build by
    ignoring tests
<strong>9. Attend to data migration early and always test with migrated</strong>
    <strong>production data throughout delivery.</strong> Only in cases where this is
    not possible due to security reasons, use synthetic or anonymised
    data which must still be production-like
<strong>10. Create a transparent, ‘visible to all’, metrics dashboard that is fed</strong>
    <strong>automatically by the delivery pipeline tooling.</strong> Ensure that progress
    and quality are measured.</p>
